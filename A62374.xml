            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As for the Author, his other writings have made him known; and in this brief comment, upon this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, he hath delivered his judgment, Orthodoxly, and ſo conſentient to Divine Truth, that what was written of <hi>Rabanus Maurus,</hi> (ſometimes Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi>) by him, who ſet out his Commentaries upon <hi>Jeremy,</hi> may be hither applyed; <hi>Facile eſt collige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, vel ex hoc uno Authore, Spiritum ſanctum nunquam ſuam deſeruiſſe Eccleſiam,</hi> it may be eaſily collected, though but from this one Author, that the Holy Spirit hath not<note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 89.33.</note> forſaken his Church, no not in the worſt times, but hath<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.12.</note> enabled, and raiſed up faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<note n="c" place="margin">Matth. 9.37, 38.</note> labourers,<note n="d" place="margin">2 Chro. 36.15. &amp; Matth. 10.5.</note> ſending them forth into his own great harvest.</p>
            <p>Let not this <hi>poſthume</hi> little Volume of his be thought ſpurious, for that it hath lain ſo long concealed; tw'as not of ſhame to ſhew it's face; but for that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in ſo quaint an Age, it wanted better garments; at leaſt, ſome trimming upon it's plain cloth: in totter'd times, it may hope to paſs, though in an home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet in an untorngarb: in ſhort, the watch may be of good materials, albeit the maker of it be by time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventet for to crave, or to enamel it: I ſhall deſire the Reader, now, to view truth, in this Book, as in it's firſt naked ſimplicity, without the dreſſings, or curlings, or ornaments of Rhetorick, which like to painted glaſs in a fair window, often hinder the native beauty of the purer light.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96820:31"/>home; And, how many preſent in the Congregation, whoſe hearts tremble not at the Word?</p>
                  <p>A ſecond particular ſin, in this kind, is, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21.13. Lack of commiſeration of our Brethrens neceſſities; though men, ſo diſpoſed, make long prayers, yet the Lord will not heare.</p>
                  <p>A third, that here mentioned, Careleſs performance of the worſhip of God; this makes all ſervices abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Amongſt other Sacrifices acceptable to God, there was one eſpecially pleaſing, namely, The (whole) burnt offering; Figuring, perhaps, that fervent affection that ſhould ſhew it ſelf in every ſervice, performed by us to our God; See <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. other temper better fits in any thing, than in the ſervice of God.</p>
                  <p>Again, Is it ſuch a judgment, not to be accepted in praying? A heavy judgment therefore, to be void of the ſpirit of Prayer, and Deprecation; as <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. And, this the ſtate of our people, that cannot pray.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This hath been by your means.</hi>] That is, the offering of blind, lame, &amp;c. And ſo you ſhall ſee, in ſundry Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, ſins of People imputed to defects of Teachers.</p>
                  <p>If any demand, why? For default of better inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and neglect of duty that way; or, 2.

By admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the lame ſacrifices, without reproofe, or rejection.</p>

He knows not what he doth, neither is able to diſcerne the Lords Body: Surely, if the Lord impute to the Levites the profaneneſs of the people, becauſe they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their Sacrifices, without difference; how Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can be free from profaning the Lords Ordinance, that admit the blind and lame to the Lords Table, I ſee not.</p>
                  <p>And this, methinks, ſhould ſtay the fury and malice of unreaſonable, and evill men, againſt Miniſters, in this behalf; that they are carefull not to admit, hand over head, every man that offers himſelf to the Lords Table: Now, Lord be mercifull to my perſonall ſins! I know, if he ſhould enter into judgment for the ſins of mine own Perſon, I am not able to abide it; but, if the Lord will alſo impute to us the neglects of our people; can any blame, if we deſire to keep off that burthen?</p>
                  <p>And, let no man ſay, The Miniſter is excuſed, and the ſin is only the Parties, that adventureth; This plea, if it could have holden, might have been made by the Prieſts of the Jews: They offered ſuch as the people brought; had they brought better, better they would have offered; yet this made their ſin, becauſe the Lord had forbidden the offering of ſuch, upon what pretence ſoever brought unto them.</p>

                  <p>Not the Sacrifice of Chriſt; for, that was offered, in one place, without the Gates of <hi>Hieruſalem, Heb.</hi> 13.12. Nor Jewiſh Sacrifices: For, this is oppoſed to Jewiſh Sacrifices; and they were to be aboliſhed, and determined in Chriſt: Nor, the ſacrifices of Chriſtians: It remains, therefore, that it is the Sacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
                  <p>Now, that we aſſume, is, That it is to be underſtood of the ſpirituall ſacrifice of Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. But, that this cannot be here meant, they thus reaſon: Firſt, The ſacrifice here ſpoken of, is called abſolutely, <hi>Mincha,</hi> A Sacrifice, or Incenſe; but, when the Scripture ſpeaks of ſpirituall Sacrifices, it uſeth a Terme diminuent, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Analogicall, and improper uſe of the word.

                  <p>A third Argument; The Prophet ſpeaks of in Sacrifice to be offered; by (Prieſts) of the new Teſtament; But Prayers are offered alſo, by (People.) I anſwer, Not ſo; but a Sacrifice to be offered by all the people, in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church; who are all made Prieſts unto God 5 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6.

                  <p>A fifth; A (pure) offering; but ſo are not ſpiritual Sacrifices of Chriſtians, according to Pro eſtants. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Though impure in themſelves; yet pure, 1, by accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; becauſe accepted as pure, for Chriſts ſake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. In reſpect, that God covers iniquity in his Children; <hi>Num.</hi> 23.21. <hi>He ſeeth none iniquity in</hi> Jacob; there (is) abundance; but he (ſeeth) none, that is, taketh notice of none, 2. Pure, in compariſon of hypocriticall Jews, as, <hi>Hab,</hi> 1.13. Some are ſaid to be righteous, in compariſon; The wicked devoureth him, that is righteous, in reſpect of himſelf: So, theſe Sacrifices in Chriſtians, pure; not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; but in reſpect of thoſe, that hypocrites offered amongſt the Jews, 3. Pure, in reſpect of ſincerity, and ſingle heartedneſs; pure, from hypocriſie: ſuch Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall purity is; every where, ſpoken of, as, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.

                     <hi>And the fruit thereof, even his meat is contemptible.]</hi> Here is a finding fault with the providence of God, in our maintenance; See the Text; his <hi>Provenius,</hi> that is, thoſe iſſues that come by Gods ordinance, unto the Prieſts, for their ſuſtenance, They counted it a baſe allowance, and contemptible meat: For the better underſtanding of the words, we muſt know, that of the ſacrifices dedicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, there was a Portion due unto the Prieſts; as, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. eſpecially, in the ſin-offerings, where
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96820:39"/>with they were maintained: Now, this is noted as their fault, that the Lord having thus liberally provided for them, they counted the allowance baſe, and not good enough for them; this their fault: The ſame ſee in the Iſraelites, when God had fed them, a long time, with Manna, meat meet for Angells, if they ſhould eat; mark, how they murmure; nothing but Manna, they muſt have fleſh, and that of the daintieſt: The ſame Fault-find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Lords Portion, and allorment, is rife in our people: The poor, he grudgeth at his hard fare, though he may live in it, feele the Lords good providence, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it ſtrength to nouriſh, and preſerve in health, beauty, and ſtrength of body. The Labourer, he grudgeth at the Gentleman, that he lives at ſuch eaſe; though, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, his ſleep be a thouſand times more ſweet, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et unto him. And, in a word, go over all ſtates, and you ſhall find this murmuring againſt the providence of God, in the means allotted by him, for their maintenance.</p>
                  <p>Cauſes hereof two: 1. An over weening conceit we have of our own worth, and deſerving; we ſeem to our ſelves to have deſerved better things at Gods hands, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, alas! not the leaſt morſell of the courſeſt bread is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by us. 2. Lack of perſwaſion of Gods love, in our deſignment to our particular ſtates: A man perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Gods fatherly love, thus eaſily reſolves, what ſtate God placeth him in, that is beſt for him; knowing, that if another were better for him, God, being a father, would not deny it him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Well, Let us hence learn to profit our ſelves in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Law of God; ſurely, it is the end, why the Law entred, that ſin, that is, the knowledge of ſin might abound; And, that man, that knows the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own miſery by the Law, is beſt fitted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, what is the height, and length, and breadth, and depth of the Love of God, in Chriſt, revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. Learn we, therefore, by this, and the like Scriptures,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96820:39"/>to make the full meaning of the Law familiar unto us.</p>
                  <p>It is one main cauſe of that ſottiſh pride, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous opinion men carry of themſelves, as that they know not what the Law means.

Heare Chriſts reaſon; all is not loſt that is done in ſecret: though men ſee not, God ſeeth, and hath his book of remembrance written, for thoſe that feare him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. 2 Thy piety will beſt be manifeſt, by Gods reward; In this life, his bleſſings ſhall follow thee, ſo that men ſhall ſay, ſurely, this man fears God, though condemned by us; for the Lord rewards him; or elſe, after this life.</p>
                  <p>And it reproves this vice, ſo rife in all ſtates, whoſe own tongues muſt be the Trumpets of their own Praiſes; but, ſaith <hi>Solomon, Let another mans mouth praiſe thee, and not thine own:</hi> Haſt thou been bountifull to the poore?

Firſt, From deſcription of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. Secondly, Of Gods Majeſty. In the deſcription of the Hypocrite; we ſee, 1. His Title, A Deceiver, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinator, a plotter, and deviſer, how to deceive, to wit, with ſhews of devotion: Deceivers they are: 1. Of God, in intention, dealing cunningly with him in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, vowing many things in extremities, performance none, or ſlender. 2. Of men. It ſhall not be amiſs a little to note how: Firſt, one cunning they have, that they may ſeem holy, and devout; they are commonly firſt, and ſharpeſt in cenſuring, and condemning others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. In the mean time, diſſolute in their own lives; and the leaſt moats they can eſpy in another, their own beams in the mean time, diſſembled; our Saviour carped at, for converſing with ſinners, and oppreſſors; themſelves noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for rapines, and extreme oppreſſion: A cunning ſleight, and rife, at this day, among many; That they Cenſoriouſly, judg of others, take liberty over-enough, in their own lives: Whereas, true love covers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. and is compaſſionate, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. A ſecond cunning they have, in deceiving men withall, is externall conformity to the parts of the Worſhip of God; when as, in private
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96820:42"/>life, none more negligent, or careleſs, then they: If a man had ſeen the devotion of Phariſees, in their Prayers, would he not preſently have ſaid, behold, a devout man! yet, in private life who more abominable? meaſure thy ſelf, then, by private carriage. But, their worſt deceit is, That by all this, they beguile their own ſouls, as <hi>Jam</hi> 1.26. failing of all their intentions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And voweth.</hi>] Their ſecond property is, that they are forward to vow the beſt, in their extremities; when Gods hand is upon them, nothing too dear for him; but, when Gods hand is removed, as if they repented their forwardneſs, they ſerve him with the corrupt: This ye may ſee, in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when Gods hand was upon him, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſent for, ſin confeſſed, great mind to let Gods people go; when Gods hand removed, then, to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and diſtinguiſh; they might, but, their children muſt ſtay; then, (they) might go, but their Cattle muſt ſtay behind.</p>
                  <p>See we, whether this be not, in our people; when fear of death oppreſſeth them, then, how carefull will they be? If God reſtore them to health; then all but deluſion, as in <hi>Achab;</hi> A little for eaſe; health reſtored, no token of humiliation, or repentance: So, in ſpirituall extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whileſt conſcience affrights; all the world for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; yet preſently, their old By as taken unto; Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vow made in Baptiſme broken.</p>
                  <p>Now, Beloved, Let us beware of this mark, and brand of Hypocriſie; and what we vow, let us make conſcience to performe; it is ill dallying with the Lord: Let me add the Curſe, as a reaſon to preſs it; Curſe outward, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.4, 5. Inward, in hardneſs of heart, as we ſee in common practice, their laſt end worſe, than their beginning.</p>
                  <p>And here I may take occaſion to treat, ſhortly, of the Doctrine of Vows.</p>
                  <p>A Vow is a ſolemn,<note place="margin">What a Vow is</note> and holy promiſe made unto God, deliberately, and with adviſement, whereby we bind our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96820:42"/>ſelves to do, or omit ſomething, that we know is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto him. I call it, firſt, A promiſe; next, a ſolemn, and religious promiſe, to put difference betwixt promiſes made unto men; Thirdly, unto God, becauſe, this a part of Invocation, and Confeſſion: The matter of Vows, things acceptable unto God.</p>
                  <p>Whether they may be made, under the Goſpell? I take it, yes: perhaps, not that neceſſity now, that then was; but yet, lawfulneſs the ſame; becauſe, 1. Helps of devotion, when rightly underſtood. 2. A common Vow made in Baptiſm, renewed in the Lords Supper, after the ordinance of God. 3. As teſtimonies of thankfulneſs, &amp;c. Yet, indeed, ſundry Caveats there are herein to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; let me touch the principall. Firſt, Some concerne the matter of Vows; In this matter, are two things: 1. Lawfulneſs, 2. Poſſibility. Lawfulneſs; for, when we vow things unlawfull, we profane the name of God; nor can this be acceptable unto God: Againſt this condition ſinned thoſe Jews, that had bound themſelves with Vow, and Oath; not to eat, till they had ſlain <hi>Paul;</hi> and thoſe vile wretches, amongſt the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> that with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn receiving of the Sacrament, bind themſelves to the murther of the Lords Annointed: Such thoſe of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, our Gallants eſpecially, that vow revenge; and that Vow once made, no means of appeaſement; thus, Vows that ſhould be bonds of obedience, become obligations to rebellion, and diſobedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Poſſibility of things, in our power, that we have ability, by grace, or other means, to perform; for, what a dallying were this with the Lord, and how preſumptuous, on our part, to vow what we have not power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Thus ſin Papiſts, at this day, in vowing continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in ſingle life; A thing out of compaſs of mans power, except there be ſpeciall grace given of God: And, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they ſay, ſo are repentance, new obedience, but, by grace, poſſible. Anſwer, Grace is of two ſorts; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96820:43"/>to Salvation; ſuch repentance; this promiſed to all Gods Children, upon their endeavours: The other ſpeciall, and given to none, but by ſpeciall priviledge. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.36.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Caveat to be reſpected, is, the ſtate of our Perſons; namely, That they be <hi>ſui juris,</hi> Free men; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe otherwiſe, there is a disjointing of Gods Ordinance, and a robbing of men of that honour, which God hath given them: Therefore, <hi>Num.</hi> 30. when a Child, or wife, hath vowed any thing, without privity, and conſent of Superiours, the Lord gave them power to abrogate it: And therefore they, in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that allow unto children authority to vow Monaſtical life, without free conſent of their Parents, abominable.</p>
                  <p>A third thing to be regarded, is, the manner, and grounds of vowing; See <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, &amp;c.</hi> Deliberation, in this caſe, much to be regarded; as, firſt, of the matter, wherein <hi>Jephtah</hi> ſinned, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11. Secondly, Whether we have aſſurance of ſtrength, and power, to perform what we vow, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.35. otherwiſe, we make them ſnares unto us, and unneceſſary entanglements. Thirdly, Whether God call us thereto, or no; for, then may we aſſure our ſelves of aſſiſtance in performance; And this calling is gathered; partly, by neceſſity; partly, by aſſurance of ability. Fourthly, the end; not merit; but, as helps to us in obedience: So, if a man ſhall find a Vow may be a bridle unto him, for ſome exceſſe, or a ſpurr to devotion; lawfull: not otherwiſe. Fiftly, That it be done ſeldome, and ſparingly; otherwiſe, Satan gets advantage, and ſuch wounds are grievous. Sixthly, That we be void of preſumption; and therefore, good in all Vows, to interpoſe that condition; if God will, if God permit: Many, through preſumption, have fallen, to their more grievous wound, as <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Laſt thing, is, performance of Vows; every where ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.4. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.18. <hi>Vovete, &amp; reddite;</hi> vow,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96820:43"/>and pay unto the Lord; <hi>Vovete,</hi> is <hi>hortatorium;</hi> yet, <hi>red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, imperatorium:</hi> wherein, ancient Divines require three things. 1. Haſte to performance, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.3. Defer not to pay it; this, in the common vow of Baptiſm, violated. 2. That it be full payment, without diminution; See <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.5. I did not foreſee what would betide; as <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias, Act.</hi> 5. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and our people. 3. Diſcretion; this the ſin of <hi>Jephtah,</hi> as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, he was, <hi>in voven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſtultus; In reddendo, impius:</hi> Folly he ſhewed, in vowing; for, if it were generally underſtood, then, if a Dog, or an Aſs had met him, he ſhould have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; again, as fooliſh in performance; For, 1. The Law of God had provided redemption of ſome, even lawfull Vows. 2. Being ſo fondly vowed, raſhneſs was to be repented, but the Vow not to be performed: <hi>Votum du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, abſolutum conditionatum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, About diſpenſation with Vows; the quaere is, whether diſpenſable, or commutable? Anſwer is, when as lawfully made unto God, cannot be diſpenſed withall, but by the Lord himſelf, for none can diſpence with the Commandements of God: Therefore, Papiſts here taxed.</p>
                  <p>And, let the Uſe of all this be thus much unto us; <label type="milestone">

Vows are of two ſorts; publique, and ſolemn; ſingular, and private, &amp;c. I would be Author to no man to be haſty in vowing; ſeriouſly weighing humane frailty; but, if he have vowed, let him make conſcience to perform.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>I am a great King.</hi>] Firſt, in largeneſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. 2. In power of adminiſtring; as appears, that he hath all Creatures at his command; therefore ſtyled, Lord of Hoſts: His Kingdom is, of power, of grace; of power, over the very wicked; ſeen, in reſtrayining, in over-ruling, in deſtroying his Enemies: Of grace, in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, in protecting, in glorifying his Church.</p>

                  <p>Caveats here are: Firſt, That the Fact be publique, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. In private ſins, another courſe to be holden, ſo long as any hope of Reformation appears. 2.

                  <p>And this the Doctrine, the Practice whereof ſo diſtaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to carnall men; <label type="milestone">

                  <p>So then, It is a duty ſpecially belonging to Miniſters, to ſee to the Reformation of Religion, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
                     </label> and maintaining thereof, in purity; See for this, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. Let us ſee how this is to be underſtood. Papiſts underſtand it, Excluſively, ſo that they would not have Civill Magiſtrates to have any thing to do, in matters of Religion, and the worſhip of God: Now, that even in matters Eccleſiaſticall, the Civill Magiſtrate hath power of commanding, appears: 1. <hi>Signis, Deut.</hi> 17.18. A charge is given, that the Book of the Law be delivered to the King, not only for private information of his life; but, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well ſaith, That he might provide, that others alſo obſerve it. 2. <hi>A minori,</hi> If Fathers, in Families, muſt deale in information of Houſholds, how much more the King? 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. Godlineſs, as well as honeſty, muſt be promoted by them. 4. <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. and 18. Neglect of Reformation is imputed to lack of Magiſtrates, which what argues it, but a duty to promote purity of the worſhip of God. 5. Kings in <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> blamed for tollerating abuſes, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for care in reforming, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, That we may ſee, what the duty of Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates is, in this kind; See we what they may not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with. Secondly, what concernes them, in duty, in this kind. 1. The execution of Miniſteriall Functions belongs not unto them, becauſe, they are not thereto called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. Therefore, <hi>Saul</hi> blamed for this, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. In that, being a King, he would take upon him, to burn Sacrifice; and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16, is ſaid, to tranſgreſs the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96820:46"/>Commandement of the Lord herein; and <hi>Amaziah</hi> well tells him, it is not for him to burn Incenſe; and, the Lord ſtrikes him with Leproſie.</p>
                  <p>See we, now, what it is, that belongs unto them. 1 Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws, for ſtabliſhing pure Religion, aboliſhing of falſe; See this, as, in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Dan.</hi> 3. ſo in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> &amp;c. commended. 3. To ſee to the execution of thoſe Laws; So, it is ſaid of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> he compelled thoſe that were found in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> to ſerve the Lord, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 34.33. 4, To enjoine every Church-Officer, to ſee to his office, and place, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.4. 5. To aſſign to every one his particular ſtation, and calling, in the Church, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.7. 6. To correct, and puniſh omiſſions: So that, this Doctrine is not, excluſively, to be underſtood, in reſpect of the Civill Magiſtrate; but ſerves only to awaken the Prieſts, that were, in this point of duty, moſt negligent: And, parts of the Prieſts duty, this way, are: 1. To teach. 2. To exerciſe Diſcipline,</p>
                  <p>Therefore, how well they diſcharge Miniſteriall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that are the foremoſt in corrupting the ſincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; conſider we: Corruptions in Religion are of two ſorts: 1. In matter. 2. In manner. In matter, when means of worſhip not preſcribed, are brought in by men, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 159. How full of ſuch Corruptions is the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> In manner, when abuſes in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, are tolerated: Secondly, See here, what we have to anſwer to that common objection of the people; That we meddle where we need not, when we oppoſe our felves to corruptions in Religion: As, to inſiſt in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, Profane abuſe of the Sacrament; the common ſaying is, The unworthy Communicant ſhall himſelf ſmart for his profaneneſs, True; yet the Miniſter alſo, For, to him is this Commandement given, to inhibit, as much as in him lyeth, all profaning of the Lords holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we to the threatning: <label type="milestone">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96820:46"/>how the Lord, in threatning of Judgment, interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth condition of obedience, and repentance; which if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the ſtreame of Gods judgments is ſtayed; See <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> See then, how true it is, what the Lord profeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. That he delights not in the death of ſinners, but rather would, they ſhould convert and live, that every mouth may be ſtopped: And ſee, whether ever the Lord was haſty (before warning) to execute judgment upon any people: The old world had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their waies before God; yet not ſuddenly ſwept away, but <hi>Noah</hi> (a Preacher of righteouſneſs) given to warn them; So, in <hi>Sodom, Lots</hi> example, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; So <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> often would the Lord have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them; with our ſelves, the Lord hath thus dealt.</p>
                  <p>Then, that we may avert, and turn away the judgments of God from us: See our duty, of two branches: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> 1. To hear, that is, with attention and regard, to mark what the Lord requireth of us. 2. To lay it to heart: And, this duty hath in it two things: Firſt, Due conſideration of what the Lord enjoynes. Secondly, Reſolution, and care, to put it into practice; the other without this, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Laſtly, To give glory to God, by reforming abuſes, crept in upon us.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, The Lord hath come near unto us, in ſundry judgments: Peſtilence hath long dwelt in our Land; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and ſcarcity have been oft amongſt us: greater Judgments may be expected, if theſe be neglected; and yet, who cares to heare? Or, hearing, who conſiders? Or, conſidering, who reforms? So that, juſt muſt needs be our deſtruction, whenſoever the Lord ſhall bring it upon us.</p>
                  <p>See the Judgments: 1. Curſe their bleſſings, that is, weaken their abundance. 2. Corrupting their ſeed, ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away hope of recovery. 3. Caſt dung upon their

Nay, deadly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. For, The wages of every ſin, is death.</p>
                  <p>Hear the Reaſons: 1. Becauſe, but, in part, ſanctified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.15. 2. Knowledge, in part. 3. The perfecteſt fear tryall, in extremity of juſtice, which they would not do, were their works perfect, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 43.2. 4. Taught to pray for forgiveneſs. Wherefore, if we may live free from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96820:50"/>mortall, only with veniall ſins, why may we not perfectly expiate?</p>
                  <p>What then is that perfection, that the Scripture ſpeaks of? Anſwer, 1. Perfection in Chriſt. 2. Perfection in Parts. 3. Uprightneſs, and ſincerity of heart, in all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when we are free from hypocriſie; And this is that, here, commended in <hi>Levi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this verſe, then, we have two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The behaviour of <hi>Levi;</hi> in two things; In Doctrine; and in life. In Doctrine, Truth, and it only: In life, peaceable, and equall carriage: In both, ſincerity, and uprightneſs before God: Where, 2. we have the effect of theſe two, <hi>He turned many from iniquity.</hi>

                  <p>See here the deſcription of a true Paſtor, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> in foure qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: 1. That they are Teachers. 2. Teachers of truth only, without mixture of errours, or humane inventions. 3. That they are men of inoffenſive life. 4. That they are upright in all theſe, and walk as with God. Their firſt good property, is, That they are Teachers; therefore, it is ſaid, that the Law of truth was not only in his braine, or in his heart, but that it was in his lips, and in his mouth; therefore, we are called, Feeders of others, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15. Voices, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Aaron</hi> had Bells on the skirts of his Garment, and his ſound muſt be heard, when he goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>Second property, That, as he taught, ſo he taught truth, and meere truth, without wilfull mixture of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or other corruptions; therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> as he bids us preach, ſo to preach the Word, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. and, it muſt be wholſome Doctrine; and, Phariſees are blamed, not, for that they taught nothing but errour, (for ſome truth they taught, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.1, 2.) but, for that they (mingled) errours, and humane devices; <hi>Mat.</hi> 16, 6. as Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that ſoured the whole lump.</p>
                  <p>Third this, That as he taught well; ſo, he lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, and inoffenſively; a ſingular duty of a Miniſter;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96820:51"/>See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. As much care takes the Apoſtle, to inſtruct touching life, as a liberty of teaching: and <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. Let light ſhine by good works; See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> and the myſtery of <hi>

                  <p>Fourth, That all this was done, in ſincerity, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of heart: this that <hi>Paul</hi> challengeth to himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12, and counts it his chief comfort; walking with God; that is, when a man is not carried away with the ſtreame of the times, but keeps on a conſtant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of approving himſelf, and his heart, to God.</p>

All ſuch, as having ability, yet uſe not their gifts, to the good of Gods people; See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. the gifts of the Spirit are given, to profit withall; called diſpenſers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. and, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10.

                  <p>Fourthly, That are outwardly painfull, and honeſt; vet, without uprightneſs of heart, in the ſight of God; <hi>Phil,</hi> 1.15. Some ſuch ſpoken of, that preached Chriſt, indeed, but it was, out of envy, or, for filthy Lucre; ſuch

                  <p>And, this may not ſeem ſtrange, in as much as even amongſt men, rightly judging, this is a thing odious, to degenerate from our Lineage, and Predeceſſors; but, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion much more.

                  </p>
                  <p>I will ſingle out but a few of their worthy examples: 1. Their love of Gods truth manifeſted, eſpecially, in theſe three particulars: Firſt, their fervent deſires to be hearers of it; as, whoſoever ſhall read the hiſtories of our Church, he cannot but acknowledg; as, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. The word of God was precious in thoſe daies, when there was no manifeſt viſion; how frequent was it with them, then, to ride many a skore miles to heare a Sermon, ſetting apart all worldly employments! But, alas! How are our people degenerated, in this kind! To whom when the Lord comes home, even in every of our particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet audience not vouchſafed.</p>
                  <p>Again, How dear was the word of God unto them, when, for it, and to maintain it, in purity, how many of them laid down their lives, and ſhed their bloud! Read the hiſtories of our Martyrs, ſet out for this end; and, you ſhall ſee how many, of all ſorts, and conditions, the Lord then crowned with Martyrdom, and with what conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they embraced the extremeſt torments, for Chriſts ſake.</p>
                  <p>But behold, degenerate children! How do we flinch even at the leaſt verball perſecution, if it be but a ſcoff! and what they counted their glory, and that juſtly, we now count our ſhame; to be profeſſors of the Goſpell. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in education of Children, and in ſtraight charging of them, to maintain the truth, which they ſealed with their bloud, how forward were they? O we ſlow-backs, in this neceſſary duty!</p>
                  <p>Time would faile me to ſpeak of their temperance, the juſt condemnation of our gluttonous times; their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, condemning our jangling; their hoſpitality,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96820:58"/>condemning our nigardly living to our ſelves: Theſe things we can, oft, talk of; Lord! that we did make conſcience, to walk, and to tread in their ſteps; we wonder, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Eccl.</hi> 7.10. Why it is, that former daies were better, than theſe; though we enquire not wiſely of theſe things, when our manners are ſo far worſe than theirs.</p>
                  <p>More particularly; I doubt not but many of us can ſay, and that truly, that God hath given us our own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents, Patterns of many excellent graces, Gravity, Piety, love of Religion, Bountifulneſs, &amp;c. ſhall t not be our ſin, and ſhame, to degenerate, and diſgrace our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies? What greater ſhame can there be, than for the Son to talk of his Fathers Religion, himſelf living as an Atheiſt? Of his Fathers bounty, himſelf a niggard? Of his Fathers zeale, himſelf a luke-warme Monſter?</p>
                  <p>Now, ſurely, as theſe ſins are odious in whomſoever; So moſt odious in thoſe, who have had ſo worthy Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, as examples, to go before them. To conclud this point, as <hi>Eſay,</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Cap.</hi> 51.2. Conſider <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> your Father, and <hi>Sarah</hi> that bare you; Conſider every of us, and call to mind their commendable parts; Surely, of all things, the Lord moſt hates degenerating Children.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, we may hence well obſerve; That the piety of the Parent ſhall not priviledge the degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Child from the wrath of God; <label type="milestone">

The Lord purpoſely teacheh thus much: when the unthankfull Jews began to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and condemn the Lord of injuſtice, for their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as if they had ſmarted for their Fathers ſins, only; The Lord proteſteth, that the Son ſhall not dye for the Fathers ſin; nor, on the contrary, a degenerate Child ſhall not live, by his Fathers righteouſneſs, except he walk in his fathers ſteps: And, this that the Scripture affirmes, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his (own) faith.</hi>

Anſwer, It is true, that it pleaſeth the Lord, remembring the righteous dealing of Fore-fathers, ſometimes to beſtow outward mercies upon degenerating Children: But then, theſe are not to them, in the nature of bleſſings; ſuch an one may have wealth, but to his hurt, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks: <hi>Riches reſerved to the hurt of the owners thereof.</hi> 2.

And this is, indeed, a Bleſſing if men know how aright to uſe it: Its a Bleſſing, when the Lord permits a man a Religious Parent, as above; but, ſhall we, therefore, thinke, that we are priviledged from Gods wrath, being degenerate? nay rather, not much more laid open to his fierce Indignation, becauſe of our declinings? was thy father Religious?

The Hypocrites are brought in reaſoning the caſe with the Lord, why he ſhould not reſpect their faſting: And, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. As lightly as <hi>Eſau</hi> eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of that favour of God, in his primogeniture; yet when he ſees himſelf deprived of the bleſſing; how weepes he, and howls to think of it?</p>
                  <p>This one Reaſon of it, there ſeems to me to be; namely, becauſe there is not the wickdeſt man that lives, but knows, and thinks this, that the top of bleſſedneſs conſiſts in Gods favour, and the teſtimonies thereof: <hi>Balaam,</hi> as vile a wretch as he was, he could wiſh <hi>to dye the death of the righteous,</hi> when he had ſeen the bleſſednes that God had provided to beſtow upon his Church, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.10. And, I am perſwaded, howſoever we have many at this day, that like Atheiſts <hi>mock at the counſell of the poor, becauſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96820:64"/>he makes God his hope,</hi> Pſal. 14.6. Yet, he wiſheth from his heart, he were as many of them be; ſo well acquainted with Gods will, ſo ſenſibly favoured of the Lord, and ſo highly aſſured of his love: All the world for a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in extremity.</p>
                  <p>Now, hence it follows, that (every) grief for the loſs of Gods favour, is no token of a childe of God; becauſe, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>
                     </label> even wicked men may have it; a very caſt-away may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the loſs of Gods favour, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did; he may be diſcontented at the Lords teſtifying his diſpleaſure, as <hi>Cain;</hi> and therefore, let no man thus conclude; It grieves me to think, that the Lord favours me not, therefore, I am a Child of God.</p>
                  <p>And yet, its true, there is a kinde of grieving for the teſtimonies of Gods dis-favour, that is a true note of a Child of God; and therefore, let us examine it.</p>
                  <p>Signes of that grieving for the lack of Gods favour, that is a note of a childe of God, are. 1. A Childe of God, that is indeed ſorrowfull for the loſs of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; he is never at quiet, till he have recovered the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tokens of it; as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. When <hi>David</hi> had offended the Lord by thoſe his fearfull ſins, ſee how he profeſſeth of himſelf, that he found no quiet in himſelf, till he had recovered it; conferr <hi>Iob</hi> 33. Sleep, and all things, are unpleaſant to him: with a wicked man, its not ſo ordinary; though, perhaps, it may diſquiet him ſome time, yet the ſtorme is ſoon blown over; and, you ſhall ſee, ſuch is the like eſteeme of it, that, as they ſpeak, it ſhall never break their ſleep; they will never eate, or drink leſs, &amp;c. By this try thy ſelf. 2. Confeſſion of ſins, as the cauſe of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. And, they will be the firſt, who will accuſe themſelves, and acknowledg, that its juſt with God, thus to plague them; with a wicked man, not ſo. 3. A deſire to remove all things, that may offend, and continue the Lords diſpleaſure; as <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7. When it pleaſeth the Lord, to manifeſt his diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:96820:65"/>for their ſin, and the Lord hath made known the cauſe of it; <hi>Ioſhua</hi> preſently goes about the removall: Thus is it, with all Gods Children, and nothing ſo dear, but they part with, to recover his love: Not ſo, with a wicked man: gladly, would he have Gods favour; but doth nothing to procure it; if they may have his favour, together with the pleaſures, and profits of their ſins, they are contented; if otherwiſe, rather then loſe their pleaſures, farewell Gods favour. 4. Inſtant prayer, and that, without ceaſing. as in <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. Not ſo with a wicked man; <hi>hypocrites in heart encreaſeth the wrath, for they call not, when the Lord binds them,</hi> Iob 36.13. 5. Bitter complaint, under that ſad condition, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. &amp; 84. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.9.10. Bewailing alſo, and bemoaning themſelves to every one, that they think may do them eaſe. 6. The means to recover it, by diligence in Gods ſervice, are never ſlacked, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreaſed by it: In thoſe times, above all, moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to ſeek God, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. With a wicked man, not ſo; but, preſently, ſlacks he his devotion; as thoſe wretches, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. Cry preſently, <hi>its in vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it? &amp;c.</hi> 7. A Child of God reſolves, even in the middeſt of feeling Gods diſpleaſure, ſtill to continue his ſervice, what ever becomes of him; <hi>Iob</hi> 13.15, 16. <hi>Though he kill me, I will truſt in him, and never forſake him, he ſhall be my ſalvation:</hi> With an Hypocrite, and wicked man, its not ſo; if the Lord be not, preſently, mercifull again, and at their beck; preſently, they renounce him; as, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.6.7. <hi>When the Lord anſwered not Saul, by dreames, &amp;c.</hi> preſently, he flies off to a witch: And, would God, this were not too evident amongſt our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! So long as any thing can be gained by Religion, and the current of the times ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> that way, who but they? But, if the Lord juſtly be diſpleaſed, for hypocriſie, ſo that, they feel him not ſo gracious, as in times paſt; or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that he anſwers not preſently to their call, they then forſake, and renounce him. 8. A wicked mans
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96820:65"/>at the loſs of Gods favour, it works envy, and hatred againſt thoſe, to whom the Lord ſhewes moſt tokens of his love; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. compared with 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.12. ſo, in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.6, 7, 12, 28, 29. With a childe of God, its not ſo: That love of a childe of God, is a permanent grace, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.14. And, though they could wiſh to themſelves, the happineſs of other of Gods children; yet envy they not thereat, but ever magnifie the grace of God to them ſhewen.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> Is this ſo? Is this a thing that even wicked men grieve at? That the Lord rejects their ſervices? Then learn thou, for ever to acknowledg Gods favour to thee in this, when he ſhall give thee teſtimonies, and evidences thereof: And, beloved, this grace of prizing aright the favour of God, and the tokens thereof, is an excellent grace; and the lack of it cauſeth ſo much miſery to the dear children of God. Doth God hear thy prayers? Rejoyce in it, as in the greateſt happineſs in the world; doth he bleſs thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? and, art thou bettered in knowledg, and obedience? Bleſs God for it; and forget not this loving kindneſs of the Lord unto thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>And, for this end, gather as many teſtimonies of them, as poſſibly thou canſt.</p>
                  <p>What are the ſigns of it?</p>
                  <p>Falſe ſigns, outward proſperity, with the common appendices thereof; but againſt this, ſee <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 91. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come not into misfortune, as others; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they applaud themſelves in their evil.</p>
                  <p>Notes of Gods reſpecting our ſervices, are, 1. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; ſuch was that ſame ſending down of fire from heaven, 1 King. 18. and, 2 Chron 7.1. but thus, the Lord deals not, at this day. Yet, its true, there are certain ſenſible tokens of Gods accepting us, and our ſervices, at this day; which Gods children may take and eſteem, as pledges of his love. 1. Succeſs in all things that thou putteſt thine hand unto: but here, leſt I be miſtaken, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96820:66"/>by ſucceſs, not that which the world ſo eſteems, a flouriſhing, and proſperous eſtate; but this call thou ſucceſs, <hi>when all things work to thy good, Rom.</hi> 8.28. To thy true good, furthering thee, in the ſalvation of thy ſoul; or when outward proſperity makes the full of good works; and, fearfull is the eſtate of thoſe, to whom theſe things work evill; when proſperity puffs up the heart; or, when afflictions amend not, when hearing betters not, &amp;c. Fear then, leſt the Lord be angry with thee. 2. When the Lord ſhall bleſs thee, <hi>in ſpirituall things, in Chriſt Jeſus, Eph.</hi> 1.3. That is, when thou ſhalt feel this fruit of the ſervice of God; that, thereby the graces of God be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and encreaſed; that a token; that God accepts thy ſervice. 3. Thou ſhalt perceive it, by that inward teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and certificate, that Gods Spirit gives to thee, in thy conſcience: God deals not, now, with us, as he did with <hi>Cornelius; Act.</hi> 10.3. To ſend an Angell from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to tell us, that our prayers, and almes-deeds are accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God: but this he doth, he ſends his Spirit into our hearts, that aſſures us, by the word of God, that our cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes pleaſe him; theſe if thou feel, bleſs God for them; and, thus think, they are ſuch, as even wicked men, ſometimes, would redeem with the loſs of all that they enjoy.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>3</label> Is this ſo? Then mark what a miſerable caſe ſuch men live in, as when the Lord gives many teſtimonies, that he rejects both them, and their ſervices, yet are no whit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therewith: Surely, they come not ſo neer Heaven, as <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> for, they grieved at this, which theſe wretches never do. As, how many are there, that can ſay, and ſaying, deride all Religion, that they could never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to be any whit better for their prayers, &amp;c. What, nothing the better? And, findeſt thou no feeling of Gods love therein? Wretched man that thou art! what comfort, then, canſt thou have in thy wealth, pleaſure, honour? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Yea, if thou had'ſt all the world, what could it comfort
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96820:66"/>thee? But, how much more miſerable their condition, that are the worſe for it? For example, when God, gives wealth, they are the worſe; when he ſends afflictions, they are the more heardened: when he gives preaching, and they are the more blinded, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10.

                     <hi>Inſomuch, that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will, at your hand</hi>] Hence note we, that during ſtate of impenitency, no ſacrifice, or ſervice, is accepted with God, though performed with never ſo great devotion: See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.12. Sabbaths, and new-moons commanded, yet, in theſe people during impenitency, <hi>moſt odious, and abominable;</hi> See alſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8.</p>
                  <p>Impenitency is of two ſorts. 1. Generall 2. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: Generall impenitency is, when a man lives in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall courſe of ſinning, without any converſion at all unto God; as, before calling, and turning, by the Spirit of God: Particular is that, which, after the firſt converſion, Gods children fall into; as, they ſometimes go aſtray, ſo, for a time, perhaps, they lye unhumbled in their ſins; as <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. till <hi>Nathan</hi> comes to him. Will you hear Reaſons of it? One is, that extream hatred the Lord holds all ſins in, eſpecially, when they are thus lived in, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. Its true, that the Lord bears many ſins, in his people, ſo long as they are bewailed, and ſtriven againſt ſparing us, even as a father ſpares his own ſon that ſerveth him. And, though there be, in the deareſt children of God, abundance of iniquity, and corruption; yet whileſt they are ſtriven againſt, the Lord ſees them not, that is, he takes no notice of them, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.21. <hi>He ſeeth none ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in</hi> Iacob, <hi>nor tranſgreſsion in Iſrael,</hi> But, when a man lives in his ſins, (without repentance,) theſe ſins, even the leaſt of them, are moſt deteſtable unto him.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond reaſon of it is, becauſe no obedience can be performed by ſuch a man, in ſingleneſs of heart; and, he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96820:67"/>doth but dally with the Lord, and even mock him, who comes before him with ſuch ſervices; <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.13. <hi>This people,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>draweth neer me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me;</hi> Singleneſs of heart is that the Lord accepts.</p>
                  <p>A third Reaſon; becauſe ſuch performe not the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of acceptation; neither doth Chriſt, (during that ſtate) mediate for ſuch: Its one main condition the Lord requires in all that come neer him; that they be holy, even as he is holy, at leaſt in affection, &amp;c.</p>

                     </label> by which they were drawn into theſe ſins; the means ſeem to have been theſe. 1. The commoneſs of the ſin, and the long cuſtome of it; ſo long had it continued, and was grown ſo faſhionable, that it ſeemed to be no ſin: The like you ſhall ſee, at this day; but, ſins; when they are grown into faſhion, are ſwallowed up as no ſins; drunkenneſs, a fearfull ſin; yet, I know not how, amongſt drunken Dutch-men, ſeems no ſin at all; would God, the ſame miſchief were not too evident amongſt us! But unto this, oppoſe we this one concluſion; that commoneſs, or cuſtome, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, alters not the nature of any unlawful action: A thing forbidden, though never ſo common, never ſo anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and long continued, yet ſtill ſtayes in the nature of ſin Murther is ſtill a crying ſin, though it be ancient, almoſt as the world, as in <hi>Cain.</hi> And, that plea of others ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (Thus did our fathers, that were before us,) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the ſight of God. A ſecond occaſion of it, was, a prepoſterous, and over-haſty deſire to have the promiſes of God accompliſhed; ſo, it's thought, the Fathers were drawn to Polygamy. A promiſe they had, that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias ſhould beborn of them; impatient in expectation of the bleſsing, they betook themſelves to unlawfull meanes: <hi>Rebecca</hi> had received a promiſe of God, that <hi>Iacob</hi> the younger ſhould be the Lord of his brother, and inherit the fathers bleſſing; ſhe willing to accompliſh this promiſe upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſhe teacheth him diſſembling, and lying, Gen. 27. But, to this let us oppoſe this concluſion. That the Lord, who will have his will and purpoſe accompliſhed, will have it accompliſhed, by warrantable means; and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96820:70"/>therefore, fear thou, even to doe what God will have done, by any meanes, that he hath not ſanctified. And, by faith, depend upon God, yea, though he ſeem long to ſtay, permitting unto him the diſpenſing of the times, and appointment of meanes, to bring his purpoſe to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Now, the cauſe of this, in theſe Iewes, was, beſides the examples of the Patriarkes, and long cuſtome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a colour that they had from the bill of divorce, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by <hi>Moſes.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Of the nature of divorce</note>It ſhall not be amiſs, therefore, a little to enquire, what we are to think, touching the matter of divorce. 1. What it is. 2. Whether lawfull. 3. The kinds.</p>
                  <p>Divorce, therefore, is, in generall, the diſſolution of the marriage contract. Now, whether any divorce be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, any breaking of the knot of wedlock? ſome think no; but, that the divorce ſpoken of, in Scripture, is nothing but ſeparating from cohabitation; and that there can no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe be, of breaking the marriage-contract, rightly ſolemnized: indeed, ſome caſes they put, wherein outward ſolemnities may be fruſtrate; as, when marriage is entred by parties, not permitted by the law of God; but, if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred betwixt parties meete, no poſſible diſſolution. But, here-againſt we may oppoſe that ſentence of our Saviour <hi>Chriſt, Mat.</hi> 19.8.9. In caſe of fornication: Reaſons of it, theſe. 1. Becauſe, this utterly breaks the marriage-bond, and is moſt directly oppoſite, and contrary thereto; beſides, they muſt be one fleſh. 2. By that law of the Lord, that would have the adulterer puniſhed with death; wherein the collection is eaſy, that, after that fact, they are to be reputed, as dead; and the innocent party as free from that bond of marriage, as if the nocent were dead.</p>
                  <p>Of divorce are two ſorts. 1. One lawfull. 2. The other unlawfull: lawfull divorce is that, that is made for lawfull cauſes: Now, hereabout is all the controverſy. What are lawfull cauſes of divorce? Some have aſſigned many; as. 1. Infidelity, if a believer marry with an
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96820:70"/>Infidell, that marriage is <hi>ipſo jure nullum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the Iewes law, it was ſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. The reaſon of it was, the will of God, utterly excluding ſuch from fellowſhip with his people, till they had renounced their Idolatry, and were incorporated unto to the people of God; but, under the new Teſtament, not ſo; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>The unbelieving wife ſanctified to the believer,</hi> and hope there is of gaining.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, grievous, and capital crimes; and thus they reaſon, if for adultery, which is the leſs; then why not for Idolatry, murther? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It follows not; for underſtanding whereof, know we, that grievouſneſs of ſins, in this kinde, muſt be conſidered, eſpecially, in reſpect of marriage it ſelf. And, though it be true, that there are many ſins, more grievous than adultery; yet none, that ſo much is contrary to marriage, as adultery.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly ſterility, or barrenneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo; <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi> keep their wives, though barren; it was their croſs, and affliction, but, no warrant for divorce.</p>
                  <p>Madneſs, or danger of life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither doth this break marriage. In ſuch caſes, holy means may be uſed, for avoiding the danger; but, no attempt of divorce permitted; perhaps, that which they call ſeparation, <hi>â thoro, &amp; menſâ;</hi> but none ſuch, as whereby marriage ſhould be utterly diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>Lawful cauſes two only. 1. Adultery, Matth. 19. &amp; 5. 2. Malitious deſertion.</p>
                  <p>Unlawful divorce when as for unlawful cauſes, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is diſſolved, and a new entred: as, the Jewes for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe: if but a blemiſh in the body, if any diſlike for crooked manners, &amp;c.

                     </label> and to uſe aggravations; and it is for our admonition, that we ſhould take heed how, by them, we defile our ſelves: The end of conviction is our admonition; See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:96820:73"/>
                  <p>Now, Brethren, the Lord hath dealt mercifully with us, in this kingdome, this way, by many meanes labouring to work conviction: and happy we, if it might have this effect, to work in us admonition, and care to avoid ſin. The uſuall meanes whereby the Lord convinceth of ſin, are theſe. 1. His word. 2. Afflictions. 3. His vengeance on others. 4. The controllement, and check of our own conſcience. And, in none of theſe, hath the Lord been behinde with us; as <hi>Paul,</hi> ſin is not imputed, where is no Law; and, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. <hi>The law entred, that ſin might abound.</hi> Beloved, in daies of blindneſs, many ſins were ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, that were moſt fearfull, in the ſight of God, Idolatry, blaſphemy, breach of Sabbath, &amp;c. And thoſe, that are every where, called works of darkneſs. Now, in theſe dayes of light, the Lord hath ſhewed us <hi>what is good, Mic.</hi> 6.8. and as well, what is evill, by the light of his word; ſhall it not be our ſhame, if being convinced of ſin, we continue therein?</p>
                  <p>Second meanes, afflictions; the ſmart whereof diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers alſo the hainouſneſs of our ſins; in time of eaſe, ſins ſometimes are known, but, ſcarce throughly conſidered; afflictions, <hi>Iob</hi> 33.16. Open the eare, &amp;c. And, how the Lord hath dealt with us, this way, if we have eyes, we cannot but ſee; following us with many of his plagues, and heavy judgments; even Pharaoh could then, under affliction, confeſs, I have ſinned.</p>
                  <p>Third meanes of conviction, exemplary vengeance; of which, beſides the records of Scriptures, other ſtories are frequent; and the Lord thereby would ſhew unto us, how to eſteeme, and account of our ſins: Uſurers many brought to beggary; drunkards cloathed with raggs; falſe ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ruinated in their families; adulterers brought to a morſell of bread: theſe are our convictions, would God they were our warnings.</p>
                  <p>Fourth meanes, check of conſcience: <hi>The heart ſmites it ſelf,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. and, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. As, the Diſciples of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96820:73"/>Chriſt, <hi>did not our hearts burn within us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 24.23.</note> 
                     <hi>whileſt he tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with us, and opened unto us, the Scripture?</hi> The like queſtion if I ſhould propound unto us; I know, they would anſwer, they have often felt it: Beloved, happy he, whom the Lord thus chaſtens, if he be thereby admoniſhed; and, woe to us, if being convicted of ſin, we ſtill continue therein.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, let me exhort, therefore, every one of us, to whom the Lord hath been thus merciful, to reveal our ſins, and to convince us of them: that the Lord may attain his end in us, to work in our hearts a care to depart from evil: how are we convinced in our judgments, by the Lords judgments, of many fearful, and crying ſins? Why reſolve we not to leavthem?</p>
                  <p>Let me add reaſons. 1. Continance of ſin, after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, as it hardens the heart; ſo makes it the ſin much more haynous in the ſight of God. <hi>If ye were blinde, ye ſhould have noe ſin,</hi> Joh. 9.41. &amp; Jam. 4.17. <hi>To him that knowes to do well, and doth it not, to him it is ſin,</hi> with an emphaſis. Every ſin, after conviction, is doubled, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.13. after all this, we have ſinned 2. Reprobates aſcend thus far, to ſee ſin, and acknowlelg it; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could ſay, <hi>I and my people are ſinners;</hi> but (forſaking) of ſin, is that only, that argues ſound grace; <hi>The fear of the Lord, is to depart from evil, to hate pride, arrrogancy, and every evil way,</hi> Prov. 8.13.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore beloved, let us thus reſolve, every of us, as it pleaſeth God, more and more to enlighten us, to ſee our ſins, and rightly to know them; ſo, with all ſpeed and earneſtneſs to leave them. I doubt not, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, at this day, hath in many of us, the ſame effect, that it had in the Primitive Church, by Gods ordinance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Would God! as it convinceth, ſo it might work deteſtation, and care to avoid ſin. <label type="milestone">

Therefore it is, that an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or ignorant conſcience, is never moved with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe never ſo ſharp, any threatning never ſo ſevere; perſecution, a grievous ſin; yet while not known to be ſuch, or thought, erroniouſly, to pleaſe God, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. never moves conſcience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, 16.

                  <p>And here, beloved is to be bewailed a defect of many of us, of good affections, I confeſs; would God, I could ſay alſo, of as good a judgment, and knowledg! that are ready, in every tranſgreſſion, to miniſter reproofes ſharp enough. Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they reprove, and ſharply alſo, I blame not; but this that I would exhort unto, that we

Mark, if thou wilt, but the different carriage of prophane men, towards men, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers diverſly reproving: How ſcoffingly carry they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in all reproofes of the ignorant? Now, let a man that hath knowledg deale with them, that is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their judgments, how doth he even arraign them, and fill them, many times, with fear and trembling? And, how fearfull are they, to oppoſe any thing? Great is the fear of conſcience once convinced; and as audacious is a wicked heart, when it is not feretted out of the ſtarting holes. 2. Add unto this, that not every admonition hath a bleſſing promiſed, but ſuch as is grounded on the word of God; as we ſay of preaching, its the mean to convert; yet it's only, when the (pure) word of God is preached. 3. Courage in the reprover is hereby much encreaſed, when as he is ſure, his ground is good; as, on the other ſide, we cannot but faulter, and halt in admoniſhing, that deal either ignorantly, or upon uncertainties.</p>

                  <p>In the accuſation, are two things. 1. The fact. 2. The mean. By this wearineſs, we are to underſtand, two things. 1. the Lords long patience, even <hi>ad defatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem uſque,</hi> towards the wicked; and the abuſe thereof, by the people. 2. His readineſs, to turn patience into wrath, and to execute vengeance upon the tranſgreſſours. Of the firſt of theſe. This is that the Lord, every where, challengeth to himſelf, and in common experience, is ſeen to practiſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2, 4. <gap reason="foreign">

So, after many long provocations, yet he gives to the old world, an hundred and twenty years; ſo to the <hi>Amorites,</hi> though their ſins were ever crying, yet four hundred years given them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.13. And, this is that, that every one of us have had plentiful experience of. What a long courſe of ſinning ran we along in, before our calling; and how bountiful found we the Lord towards us? And which, even of the deſperateſt wretches amongſt us, can ſay, that the Lord hath been haſty, to take notice of, or puniſh his rebellions? The reaſon is, to lead us to repentance, if it were poſſible, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. or otherwiſe, to leave the impenitent, excuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                  <p>Now beloved, this ſhould teach us amendment of life, and lead us on to repentance: <label type="milestone">

                  <p>It ſhall not be amiſs, therefore, a little, to ſhew a mean, to fortifie our ſelves againſt this Godleſs, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous temptation; and, for the wicked, theſe concluſions ſhall be proved. 1. That it may well enough accord with the juſtice of God, to forbear, proſper, bleſs, in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things, even wicked men; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1, Firſt of all,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96820:79"/>know we, that the will of God, and his appointment, is the rule of juſtice; ſee this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. in the caſe of Election, and Reprobation; God wills not things, becauſe they are juſt; but they are juſt, becauſe he wills them: This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion throughly ſeated in judgment, ſtops the mouths of wicked men, and reſtrains from many blaſphemies; ſo that, though the Lord bear, yet, conſidering it's his will, who may finde fault? The ſecond concluſion, that the Lord is an abſolute Lord; having free power to diſpoſe of his bleſſings, and no man may ask a reaſon of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 &amp; 11. Seeing then, that theſe things are all his own; who ſhould ask him a reaſon of his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? See alſo <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.15. A third concluſion; that what is lawful for men, cannot but be much more lawful for God. But, man ſometimes delayes, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes are not cenſured of injuſtice. The Prince uſeth not allwaies martial law, but in extremity, when he fears out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; they are kept in priſon, till the day of tryal, and conviction; and after conviction, and condemnation, have a reſpite, to prepare for death: and, thus the Lord deales with the wicked, reſpitting, and delivering them; and therefore, weigh by the end, not by the beginnings. A fourth concluſion; that the Lord, for good ends, reſerves the wicked to puniſhment; and, in the mean time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers them with temporalll things; as. 1. For exerciſe of his children, ſo <hi>Aſhur, Iſa.</hi> 10.5. deferred, to execute Gods wrath upon Iſrael, and Jeruſalem; ſo the <hi>Giben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> reſerved, to be <hi>Pricks</hi> in the eyes, and <hi>thornes</hi> in the ſides of his children; and thus the Lord, at this day, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. And beloved, what would become of us, were it not ſo? 2. To declare his power; 1. in preſervation of his own children; how wonderfully ſhews this the power of the Lord? that, notwithſtanding all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the wicked, yet ſtill his Church is preſerved; as, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> vexed, but the more vexed; the more encreaſed. 2. In converſion; Beloved, it may be,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96820:79"/>there are amongſt the very wicked themſelves, ſome, in whoſe converſion, and ſalvation, the Lord means to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his rich grace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.30. Not the <hi>tares,</hi> but the <hi>wheat</hi> alſo: If the Lord had taken away <hi>Paul,</hi> in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, his grace had never ſo much appeared; and, this that we ſee daily, men brought from power of darkneſs, to the kingdome of Jeſus <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 3. In their overthrow, and confuſion; never had Gods name been ſo marvellous over the world, if he had preſently ſhewn his power, in the deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> but, thus permitting him to fortifie himſelf, and then to overthrow him, this ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his power; like at this day, when they are flouriſhing like Cedars, then cuts he them down. A third end, this ſerves much to illuſtrate his juſtice, when he thus beares, and invites, by all meanes, to repentance, and yet men turn not: <hi>I gave her ſpace to repent, Rev.</hi> 2.21. Who cannot but acknowledg the juſtice of God, in their condemnation?</p>
                  <p>Yea, beloved, what if wicked men are puniſhed? what if puniſhed in theſe very things, wherein they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bleſſed? Theſe two things I will briefely evidence. Firſt, that the wicked are never without puniſhment. Secondly, that the very bleſſings, for which they applaud themſeves, are their puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt, know we; that puniſhments are not all of one ſort; ſome are internal; ſome external; ſome Eternal. Now, for internal puniſhments, we ſee them evident upon them; as 1. Horror of conſcience, in many of them; can there be a more fearful judgment? This, perhaps, we ſee not, but they feel in their inward reſtleſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. <hi>ult.</hi> See <hi>Cain</hi> flying (if he could) from himſelf; <hi>Paſhur</hi> a terrour to himſelf, <hi>Ier.</hi> 20.4. <hi>Achitophel,</hi> hanging himſelf; as the <hi>Romans</hi> were wont to make the crucifyed carry their own croſs; ſo God hath made the wicked to carry this croſs, of an evil, an accuſing conſcience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> If it be ſaid, they all feel it not:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, that I much doubt of. Secondly, they have
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96820:80"/>judgment much more fearful, hardneſs of heart, the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt judgment, that God in his wrath, can inflict; ſee in <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Thirdly, ſins themſelves are fearful puniſhments; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24, 26, 28. And, what drudges they are, what toil they take, to enjoy the pleaſures of their ſins? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſleeps; what filthy belchings feels the drunkard? Temporary; are in their perſons, or in the things about them; as, ſometimes, graceleſs, and unfortunate children; beſides theſe, there are <hi>paenae poſthumae,</hi> ſurviving plagues: The poſterity ſmarts for the ſins of the fathers, <hi>Job</hi> 21.19. God layes up the iniquity of the father, for the childe: And, their very outward bleſſings, what curſes are they unto them? The riches of the wicked ſuffer them not to ſleep, fill them with cares, and ſorrows, many, and many; their honours expoſed to envy, their pleaſures have bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, &amp;c. Eternal puniſhments are thoſe, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpited, till after this life.</p>
                  <p>Now, brethren, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Firſt, of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> the fore-runner of Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>John</hi> is deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by his office, the meſſenger of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by his proper effect, to prepare the way for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt doubly deſcribed. 1. By his titles. 2. And office. 3. And adjunct. Title, the Lord. Office, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Covenant. Adjunct. 1. Whom ye ſeek. 2. His coming, by the ſpeed, 3. Place, <hi>to his temple.</hi> 4. Ratification, <hi>ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the meaning of the words; ſome difficulty was cauſed by the gloſſes of the Jews; ſome teaching, that the Lord ſhould ſend an Angel, that was ſuch, by nature, as an harbinger for Chriſt. But, none can better interpret this, then the Lord Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.10. applying this to the perſon of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt:</hi> And 2. The word Angel generally ſignifies any meſſenger; though ſometimes given to the ſpirits Angelical, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96820:81"/>new ſpeech, that miniſters are called Angels, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1.</p>
                  <p>Now, by this ſcripture, we may thus profit. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
                     </label> That every man naturally is unprepared to the receiving of Chriſt; elſe, what needs ſuch preparing of the heart? And this will appear, if we conſider how hardly we are brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our ſelves, and to forſake our ſelves, that we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him: Nature cannot abide to be nothing, in its own ſalvation. Beſides, the dominion of Chriſt is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous harſh to fleſh and blood; therefore, the ſtate of a natural mans heart compared to mountains, and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.5. And moreover, the devil keeps poſſeſſion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21.</p>
                  <p>Now, beloved, labour we to feel this; and ſurely, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> it's one ſtep towards Gods kingdom, to come thus far, as to ſee, and bewail our own unfitneſs to receive him. Then, (ſaith one) are the mountains brought low, when our ſtout hearts are abated, and we are humbled, and brought on our knees, to confeſs, and bewail our own unworthineſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Its the office of a Miniſter, to prepare a way for Chriſt, that is, to prepare a people for Chriſts domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; This was <hi>Johns</hi> office; and, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf: therefore, we are called children of the <hi>bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, &amp;c.</hi> This muſt be our admonition, and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diligence, this way: and, ſuffer your ſelves to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; See <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.16, 17.</p>
                  <p>The meanes are. 1. Humiliation, by the law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. 2. Bewailing of our former lives. 3. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of amendement. 4. Longing after Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>

Now, beloved, there is a three-fold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt mentioned, in the Scripture. 1. By incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. 2. By his Spirit, into the heart. 3. In the clouds, to judgment; the firſt and ſecond here underſtood: And this buſineſs may be analogically applyed to Gods Children. Iewes never ſo longed to ſee Chriſt in the fleſh,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96820:82"/>as Gods children do, to feel his preſence in their heart.</p>
                  <p>Now, by this, try we our ſelves, whether we be chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, or no; we ſhall know it by this, that lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging deſire we feel, to be brought into communion with Chriſt, by his Spirit; as alſo, by that deſire we have, and longing after his appearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.20. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Reaſons for this. 1. Preſent afflictions; it being Gods ordinance, that we ſhall never, in this earthly taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, be free from them. 2. Subjection, and bondage under ſins, that the beſt feel themſelves tied unto; <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> long for deliverance, under their burdens, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> How not we more, from this miſerable bondage? 3. The glorious, and comfortable preſence of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shall ſuddenly come to his Temple, &amp;c.]</hi> The deſcription of Chriſts comming, by the place whither; to his Temple: namely, of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the place of Gods worſhip; and thither eſpecially, for this end, to purge it of thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, that were grown into the worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>Now, this prophecy touching Chriſts comming to the Temple, and purging the worwip of God, hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. In the Evangelicall Hiſtory y emay read it: And, the meanes which he uſed to purge the ſame, were: 1. Doctrine. 2, Diſcipline. For Doctrine, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. &amp; 15. For Diſcipline, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>Now, Brethren, ſith this is ſuch an excellent work, the purging of the worſhip of God, as that the Meſſiah, and Saviour of the world, comes to perform it; mark, what we learn: every one, in his place, to help forward this work ſo excellent: And, in reſpect of the publique, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magiſtrate, our duty is, to be petitioners unto the Lord; ſo to encline his heart, that we may have his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pure from all defilements; not only of groſs Idolatry, but even of humane Inventions: See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Next, unto every of us, in our families, this muſt be our care, as it was <hi>Joſhua'hs,</hi> for us, and our houſe-holds, to ſee,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96820:82"/>that the worſhip of God be kept pure, and ſincere: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, every family is, or ſhould be, a temple for Chriſt, to be worſhipped in; <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. We read of Churches in private mens houſes; This was <hi>Iacobs</hi> Commendable, and Holy Practice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.2, 3. <hi>going up to Bethel to build an Altar unto the Lord his deliverer; commands his houſ-hold, and all that were with him, to put away the ſtrange Gods that were amongſt them, and to cleanſe themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sundry Reaſons might be given for it. 1. That even for neglects of duties, this way, Gods wrath, many times, hangs over our heads; <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24, 25. in <hi>Moſes:</hi> And the defects this way, are reproveable; one too profane amongſt the vulgar, whoſe profeſſion is, that they hire not ſervants for Gods ſervice, but for their own; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for matter of Religion, and the worwip of God, let them do as they will; all which argues an earthly minde; and, by the preſence of ſuch ſervants, what bleſſings can be expected? Surely, as the Lord, many times, bleſſeth a whole family, for the preſence of one religious ſervant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.27. &amp; 39.5. So, for one graceleſs, profane ſervant, the whole family taſts of the Lords wrath. A ſecond neglect is, herein, perhaps more tolerable, but yet as dangerous; and that is this, that you may obſerve, even in ſome of Gods own Children; ſome care of civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they have, which reſtrains them from groſs breaches of the ſecond table, drunkenneſs, whoredome, &amp;c. Perhaps, look alſo to externall conformity; but, for matter of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in religion, altogether careleſs: Theſe things ought not ſo to be; but Inſtruction, and Correction, muſt, this way, go together.</p>
                  <p>To every one of us, alſo, may this duty be preſſed; for even we alſo are Temples for the Lord to dwell in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. And therefore, muſt we alſo be carefull, this way, to keep our ſelves from pollutions in the worſhip of God; and if any have crept upon us, labour to purge them; See <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.12, 13.</p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:96820:83"/>
                  <p>And, for this cauſe, poſitive duties this way tending are. 1. Continuall attendance unto the word of God, as the only comfortable rule of the worſhip of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 2. Beware of Philoſophy, and vain deceit, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. 3. Relying too-much upon the authority, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, or of their writings: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his mother <hi>Monica:</hi> And, this one cauſe of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Idolatry; whileſt the word of God was laid aſide, and writings of men advanced into their room. Not, that I condemn judicious reading of them; but yet, bring all to the touch, yea, even commands, and preſcripts of Princes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Ephraim</hi> afflicted, and broken in judgment, becauſe, he willingly followed the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The meſſenger</hi> (or, Angel) <hi>of the covenant</hi>] He ſpeaks, here, of the covenant of grace, made betwixt God and the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> touching life and ſalvation, to be obtained by faith, in Chriſts blould. Now, Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Angel of this covenant, in two reſpects. 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of revelation. 2. In reſpect of mediation, and procurement.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of revelation; ſo Divines teach, that the Lord, before incarnation, pleaſed, by Chriſt, to reveal his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto man; ſo Chriſt that firſt talked with <hi>Adam,</hi> that renewed covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that led the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, &amp;c. And of himſelf, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. He only reveales the Father unto us; he means, as making this covenant of grace; for otherwiſe, God known to the wicked, from the beginning, as creatour, governour, preſerver; but, as a Saviour, and Redemer, known only in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of mediation, becauſe that in him, and for his ſake, this covenant was made; ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. The <hi>mediatour between God, and man;</hi> and in, and by him, it hath accompliſhment, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                  <p>Now, whereas Chriſt is the revealer of his covenant; me thinks, it will follow, that thoſe to whom Chriſt was
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96820:83"/>not known, they never knew this covenant; and therefore, could not be partakers of ſalvation; I mean, the Gentiles to whom it pleaſed not God to reveal himſelf by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, that error, though compaſſionate, yet foul, of ſome, that taught that even the Gentiles, before Chriſt, that knew not Chriſt, were ſaved. I ſay not, but ſome Gentiles were ſaved; but, that any was ſaved, that knew not God, in Chriſt, the ſcripture no where ſheweth, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>No other name. Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>The knowledg of my righteous ſervant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, we are taught to pray to Chriſt the interpreter, to manifeſt it unto thee; and with all, take heed, how we deſpiſe the word, and tenour of this covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. the reaſons are there given.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas Chriſt alone is made the mediatour of the covenant; mark, how fouly Papiſts delude themſelves, and rob Chriſt of his honour, and ſet up ſaints, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for mediatours. They have coyned a diſtinction, of interceſſion, and redemption; ſevering thoſe things, that God hath combined, in the perſon of Chriſt; the high Prieſt a type of both; and, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. Chriſt, the Angel, that ſtands to perfume our prayers. And, this the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comfort of a childe of God: it's true, that God hath been gracious unto us, in entring covenant; but, this our miſery, that we keep not the condition; yet, this again our comfort, that the promiſes of God have not their ratification in us, but in Chriſt Jeſus: Alas! what would become of us, if ſalvation depended upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our own obedience? how full of unbeliefe? how weak in obedience? How preſumptuous in diſobedience? Yet, this the comfort, that (in Chriſt) the promiſes of God are <hi>yea, and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</p>
                  <p>Followeth the ratification, <hi>ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes</hi>] So, you ſhall ſee, that the Lord tyes his children to no other evidence, but his word, for the accompliſhment of all his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:96820:84"/>Promiſes, and predictions: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> and, <hi>The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken;</hi> and this, indeed, is faith, toreſt in the aſſurance of Gods promiſes, becauſe he hath promiſed. Other ſciences have their demonſtrations, and we have liberty, to enquire a reaſon of them; and not bound to reſt in any mans, <hi>ipſe dixit;</hi> But, for matter of faith, the Lords word muſt be our only warrant.</p>
                  <p>Now, as the Lord propounds this, as the only thing, wherein he would have his ſervants reſt; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>
                     </label> ſo let us labour, and learn to reſt, and relye only upon the word of God, for accompliſhment of all his promiſes: This is notable in <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.18. though no likelihood, to obtain feed, yet having Gods promiſe, he believes; and, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.19. When the Lord commands him to take his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in whom was the only apparent hope of the bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; yet, ſpares not him, being aſſured, that he who had promiſed, was able alſo to perform. Beloved in Chriſt, many excellent promiſes are given unto us in Chriſt; life eternal, and glory unſpeakable promiſed to all believers; yet, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. <hi>This life is hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> and, 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>It doth not yet appear, what we ſhall be.</hi> And, look to the outward State of Gods children in this life, nothing more miſerable: Well, yet, we have the Lords word, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts hath ſaid it;</hi> and though we had no other evidence, me thinks, this ſhould ſuffice us. God hath promiſed to dwell with a contrite heart, <hi>and to revive him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is of an humble ſpirit, Iſa.</hi> 57.15. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, perhaps, at preſent, we ſee nothing leſs, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving; perhaps even killing, <hi>Iob.</hi> 13.15. Here now is the power of faith, then to expect life, when we feel our ſelves in death; <hi>Godlineſs hath alſo the promiſes of this life,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8. Food in famine, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. Perhaps, we ſee no means, but now the Lord will prove our faith: And, indeed, thou canſt never aſſure thy ſelf, that thou haſt any ſound faith, till thou are come to this, to believe, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath ſaid; though thou ſeeſt no mean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96820:84"/>thine, eyes for accompliſhment of his promiſe. Labour therefore, for this; and, here conſider.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the truth of God, and his fidelity, as by long experience of all times thou mayeſt gather it. The Lord promiſed, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to give <hi>Canaan</hi> to his poſterity; <hi>Abraham</hi> lived in it, and his ſeed enjoyed it; ſo the Meſſiah; and he came.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the power of God, in accompliſhing his promiſe; theſe the two pillars of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>But, who may abide the day of his comming? and, who ſhall ſtand, when he appeareth? for, he is like a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers fire, and like fullers ſope, &amp;c.</hi>] A deſcription of the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, from the adjunct of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, illuſtrated by the effect; who may abide his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming?</p>
                  <p>For the ſence, it may be enquired, how this may be aſcribed unto Chriſt, in reſpect of his comming in the fleſh; For, firſt, his outward eſtate upon earth, was moſt deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable; his externall ſervants, fiſhermen; beſides that, he came to comfort his people; and, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20. It was ſaid of him, that he ſhould not <hi>bruiſe a broken reed? Anſw.</hi> Diſtinguiſh the Perſons, and the Scriptures will accord; Chriſt Jeſus to his own Children, is comfortable, not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; but yet, to the wicked moſt terrible; yea, in his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry incarnation, and that outward contemptible ſtate, with what terrour ſtruck he the hearts of the ungodly! See <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. When they hear but tidings of Chriſts Birth, <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and all, is in an uproare; and, when he comes meekly to <hi>Ieruſalem, riding on an aſſe,</hi> how were they ſtricken with terrour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fear? <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
                     </label> So that hence we may obſerve; that the very deſpicable ſtate of Chriſt in the fleſh, was unto the wicked moſt terrible, and diſcomfortable; mark how <hi>Herod</hi> quakes at the news, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. If any be demanded, how this comes to paſs? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Partly, through the glimps of Divine Glory, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96820:85"/>ſhined in that deſpicable State of Chriſt; partly, through their earthly mindes, while they ſavouring earthly things, feared the diſturbance of earthly peace; partly, through conſcience of rejecting him and his word: partly, through a terrour, wherewith it pleaſeth the Lord to ſtrike them.</p>
                  <p>Now, beloved, if Chriſt comming in the fleſh were ſo terrible to the wicked, what ſhall his glorious comming be? <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.16. The wicked are there deſcribed, running <hi>to the hills to fall on them, and to the mountaines to cover them:</hi> And, this terrour, methinks, ſhould perſwade men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>To forſake their ſins, and to kiſs the ſon, Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> To ſubmit to him, that he may guide them, by his word, and Spirit: The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the queſtion, <hi>who among us, ſhall dwel with devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fire?</hi> And anſwers to it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14.15.</p>
                  <p>And, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> let it be our admonition, to labour betimes, to be reconciled unto him, who is, in his wrath, a conſuming fire; <hi>behold, he commeth</hi> with <hi>clouds, Rev.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.2. The Lord is gracious unto us, in offering us meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: Bleſſed are they, that receive them; and wo worth the day, that ever they were born, that reject them I and, let all ſuch, as encourage themſelves in their evills; becauſe of Chriſts Incarnation, tremble at this: Alas I what avalls it a wicked, obſtinate ſinner, that Chriſt came into the world, to reconcile us unto his Father? This is comfortable to a mourner, but, its the ſcourge of a wicked man: when he ſhall conſider, how he hath tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under his feet the blood of Chriſt, and crucified him by his ſins, and rejected his grace, how can he but tremble?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For he is like a Refiners fire, and like Fullers ſope</hi>] Firſt, let us cleer this place of the gloſſes of Papiſts; they labour here to build the fire of purgatory; and why, trow we? but only, becauſe, here is mention made of fire, and of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fire: To which purpoſe, they apply that alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. Againſt this dream, oppoſe we. Firſt, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, and the proof of it. 1. This that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96820:85"/>every where teacheth, that we have, in Chriſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect purgation from all our ſins, both the guilt, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7. 2. That remiſſion of ſins is here, either finally loſt, or everlaſtingly obtained, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Walk while it is day.</hi> 3. Whereas they confeſs, that we are in Chriſt, purged from all mortall ſins; and all ſins are mortal; apparent, that there remaines no ſuch purging, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life. 4. Whereas they confeſs, that we are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; <hi>â Reatu peccatorum,</hi> from the guilt of ſins; how can they imagine any part of puniſhment to remain unto the children of God? for, doth God puniſh the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent? 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. Gods children are bleſſed, and ſaid, at death, <hi>to reſt from their labours; and</hi> that <hi>their works follow them</hi> cloſe.</p>
                  <p>And, as for this place, its as abſurdly, as any, applyed unto this purpoſe; For, 1. Its ſpoken of Chriſt's firſt comming in the fleſh. 2.

Now, will they ſay, that by theſe offerings, their maſs is meant? how abſurdly? For, have they maſſes, in purgatory? I think, indeed, there are Prieſts enough in hell; For, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. <hi>They that pervert Gods people, are leaſt in the kingdome of God;</hi> but, of maſſes in purgatory never dreame, no not Catholiques themſelves,</p>
                  <p>See we then, what the ſence of the words is, and in what reſpect Chriſt is compared unto fire, and Fullers ſope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In reſpect of his effects, like unto fire; and that, both in regard of the wicked, as alſo in reſpect of the children of God: In reſpect of the wicked, becauſe, by his word, afflictions, and his Spirit, he purgeth the viſible Church, works ſeparation of the droſs from the pure metall; ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12. He is deſcribed, as one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>his fanne in his hand, and purging his floore:</hi> So ſee we daily, by his word, he ſeparates; by afflictions alſo, he diſcovers hypocriſie.</p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:96820:86"/>
                  <p>And, what may this teach us? Surely, to labour to be upright in the ſight of God; for Chriſt is as purging fire, and will ſurely ſever the droſs from the ſilver, and gold; and, howſoever a man may long maſque under the vizar of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie; yet, ſooner, or later, the Lord diſcovers him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> Some mens ſins go before unto judgment.</p>
                  <p>See we the means, how it pleaſeth the Lord, at this day, to work this ſeparation: Theſe are. 1. His word, this that fire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. 2. Afflictions, this alſo the purging, and trying fire. 3. His judgment, whereby he gives over an hypocrite to ſome vile, and groſs ſins, whereby they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves unto the world.</p>
                  <p>Again, he is ſo compared, in reſpect of his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; becauſe, he ſcoureth, and purgeth them from their ſins; no fire ſo purging, as Chriſt; the fullers ſope makes not ſo white, as the bloud of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Here, firſt, take notice, how faſt corruption cleaves to all the poſterity of <hi>Adam;</hi>

                     </label> fire, and fullers ſope, that is, that which is moſt purging, required to waſh us from it. This <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.7. knew well enough, and therefore prayed again, and again, for waſhing, and wringing in this fullers ſope, of the ſpirit of Chriſt. And, what marvel? ſeeing bred in us by nature; confirmed alſo, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by cuſtom, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1.

                  <p>And, me thinks, it deſcryes that errour of our people, that think it ſo eaſy a matter to deliver themſelves from the ſtrength, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> and power of their corruptions; let them alone, they ſay, they will repent, when they are old; and, give them but their mindes, they are well enough; and, they wonder at that care, and induſtry in the ſervants of God, in labouring to keep themſelves unſpotted of the world.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:96820:86"/>
                  <p>Now, alas! Beloved, theſe men conſider not how faſt corruption cleaves unto them, while they thus ſpeak: Is it ſo eaſy, to fly from corruption? Try, if thou wilt, but in one ſin, to which thou haſt been accuſtomed; and then, tell me whether it be ſo eaſie a matter, to be delivered from thy corruptions. How do all Gods children finde evil preſent, when they would do good? And what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſſaults of Sathan are they encumbred withal? And how, when they have much laboured, yet evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſee here the efficacy, and power of Chriſt, in purging of our ſins. Fire it ſelf; and the pureſt ſope is not more powerful, then Chriſts grace: How powerful felt Gods children this, who from being, by nature, very vile, have become zealous for the Lord of Hoſtes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11?</p>
                  <p>And, this ſhould comfort the children of God, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> that endeavour to purge themſelves from their fins Beloved, it's that which often troubles the children of God, that they cannot get that power over their corruptions, that they deſire; but, the more they ſtrive, the ſtronger they ſeem to feel corruption in them: Well, wooldeſt thou, indeed, be purged? behold here a purgatory; the ſpirit of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only be ſure of this, uſe the means. And this uſe of means ſhould be both ſeaſonabe, and conſcionable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the word of God <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.29. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.17. The word is that truth, by which we are ſanctified; and by it the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that alone purgeth, indeed, is conveyed into the heart; that is the two-edged ſword, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. that ſearcheth corruption, getting into the very marrow, and bones; and, they forſake their own mercy, that leave it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, add to this a ſecond means, and that is, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſanctified to Gods children; how powerful a means the croſs fanctified is to Gods children, experience ſhews; which of Gods ſons cannot ſay, that ever he was in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he found ſin abated thereby, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

Laſtly, prayer unto God, for his Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10, 12. for, without his bieſſing, neither word, nor afflictions, nor any our own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours prevaile, any whit, to this purpoſe; therefore, ſee we many hearing continually, yet never a whit purged from corruptions; many followed with croſſes, yet never the better, but the worſe; pray God, therefore, to waſh thee, and thou walt be waſhed.</p>

                  <p>The end of Chriſt's incarnation, was, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> not only to ſave his people; but, to judg the wicked: and, he is not only a Saviour to his ſervants, but a judg to the ungodly: And, this that he profeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>Ioh</hi> 9.39. &amp; <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34. appointed for the fall, and riſing again of many in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> conferr <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8.14, 15. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.16.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are two ends of Chriſts ſending; one principall, which is to ſave: leſs principall, and as it were accidentall, to judg the world; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the Goſpell, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, 6. Or, ſecondly, by the world, we are to underſtand, the world of believers, as <hi>Auſtin; (eſt quidam quaſi mundus credentium)</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. ib. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> Chriſt refuſed to do the office of a judg, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to decide the controverſie, betwixt two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The place to be underſtood of a temporall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after the cuſtome of this life; ſo Chriſt profeſſeth to <hi>Pilate, that his kingdome was not of this world,</hi> Ioh. 18.36. But, ever performed he the office of a ſpirituall judg, as, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.39.</p>
                  <p>Hence then it followeth, that Chriſt came not into the world, only to be a Saviour of his Church, or to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to all; ſith the Lord here proteſteth, that Chriſt he came man to the world, unto judgment: This point I have often proved. 1. Becauſe of the eternall decree of God, which he would never croſs, in ſending Chriſt into the world; nay, even in it had eye to the fulfilling of that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96820:88"/>eternal counfell. 2. For that, meanes of ſalvation are not granted to all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. 3. That Chriſt excludes ſome from his interceſſion, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.9. 4. From abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; for Gods counſells muſt ſtand, and who can reſiſt his will? and, it's moſt abſurd to ſay, that God would fain ſave, but mans will hinders his intention, and deſire; ſith he that made the will, knows how to frame it to his own purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>And, therefore, beloved, vain is the confidence of thoſe men, that expect ſalvation from Chriſt, whileſt they live in their ſins: Its true, that Chriſt is a Saviour of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.21. but, a ſevere judg of all diſobedient, and impenitent ſinners: Its worth the noting that <hi>Paul</hi> hath. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The law,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not given to the righteous,</hi> namely, as its the Miniſtery of condemnation: or the hand-writing of ordinances againſt us; <hi>but, its given to the lawleſs, and diſobedient;</hi> and to them it ſtands ſtill in force.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, let this be the Exhortation, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Kiſs the ſon,</hi> that is, ſubmit to his dominion, ſuffer him to your ſaviour; elſe, ſurely, you ſhall finde him your ſevere judge.</p>
                  <p>See we, a little, how Chriſt executed this office of judgment, upon the earth, in the dayes of his fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39. namely, by blinding them that ſaw, that is, by giving men up to blindneſs of minde, and hardneſs of heart: that pleaſing themſelves in opinion of their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deſpiſed that knowledg of God which he laboured to teach them. And thus we finde Chriſt daily to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgments amongſt us in the Church of God: though we ſee him not now executing outward vengeance upon the bodies of all ungodly men; yet ſpiritual judgments we ſee on many, in the Church of God; many given up to blidneſs of minde, and hardneſs of heart, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to condemnation.</p>
                  <p>Now, as meanes to avoid this judgment. 1. Take
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96820:88"/>heed of opinion of thine own knowledg, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. 2. While we have light, walk in it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.35. 3. Shut not your eyes againſt it, but what the Lord would teach, learn to acknowledg; See <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.37, 39.</p>
                  <p>Next thing obſervable, is that part of judgment Chriſt here executed, in the dayes of his fleſh. Judgment hath four acts. 1. Examination. 2. Conviction. 3. Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence-giving. 4. Execution. Now, of theſe, this only is here noted, that here he executed the ſecond office of a judg, which is, to convince of ſin. Therefore, it is ſaid of the Father in Chriſt, that he would be a ſwift witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>the ſooth-ſayers, &amp;c.</hi> that howſoever he did not preſently ſend them down to hell; yet he would convince them of their ſins. For, this is the office of a witneſs, to convince, and give evidence of ſins committed. Now, this Chriſt did, by ſundry means.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by his word, whileſt out of it, he evidenced unto the conſcience of them, all their ſins; ſo, by ſhewing the meaning of the law, he convinced the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of their corruptions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. By ſhewing the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Prophets predictions, he convinced them of infidelity, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by his Spirit, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.8, 9. When he ſent him down into his children; and, by a general work of the true Spirit of God, in the hearts of very caſt awayes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by his own holy and ſpotleſs life; as alſo, by the examples of his childrens obedience, in whoſe hearts it pleaſed him to be effectual.</p>
                  <p>And thus, we ſhall ſee, at this day, the Lord Chriſt exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that part of judgment committed to him, by his Father. Its true, that the Lord hath long patience, bears the very veſſels of wrath prepared to deſtruction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitting their execution; as we ſee, in dayly experience; But, let no man ſay, that therefore, he doth ſit ſtill, and not judg the wicked; except, we will ſay, that the judg of aſſize performes no office of a judg, but only, when he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96820:89"/>delivers them over to be executed.</p>
                  <p>And ſee we, beloved, a little, this truth daily evidenced unto us in the Church, by the very preaching of his word, which is his teſtimony, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. How many times, perſwade I my ſelf, doth the deſperateſt contemner of God, and all goodneſs, finde that in himſelf verified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. that he is convinced of all men, and judged of the miniſtry of the word; as, when out of the word of God, we ſhew the haynouſneſs of Adultery, Sabbath-breaking, &amp;c! How ſtand ſuch offenders, like men arraigned at the barr; and ſay, ſecretly, in their hearts, they are guilty! yea, the very tryal of their countenance teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt them. Again, how doth the Spirit of God, in the word, ſmite them with fear, and horrour, that they tremble, and quake at the noiſe of Gods judgments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them? Thirdly, the very examples of Gods children, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. Whiles they ſubmit themſelves to the word of God, convince them alſo of their ſins.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe will beſt appear, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> if we ſhall conſider the ends, why it pleaſeth the Lord thus to convince us. They are two, according as the perſons are, in whom this is wrought.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in regard of Gods children, it's to humble them, by giving them ſight, and feeling of their ſins, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing themſelves, they may ſupplicate to their judg, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37.</p>
                  <p>Art thou, then, convinced in thy conſcience, out of the word of God, of thy ſins? This do, ſupplicate to the judg; ſurely, not all, whom the Lord convinceth, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth; but, as a merciful judg, though he arraign all at the barr of his conſcience, by the Word, and Spirit; yet, whom he ſees broken in heart, purpoſing amendment, earneſtly begging for pardon, to ſuch he extends pardon, and remiſſion.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, beloved, if when thou art convinced, thou canſt thus do, happy art thou: and Gods children, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96820:89"/>finde theſe things, in themſelves, have no cauſe to deſpair of pardon, and ſalvation. The end of conviction, in caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awaies, is their juſt damnation; for that, when the Lord convinced them in judgment, of their ſins, they ſtill perſiſted in them.</p>
                  <p>And therfore, beloved, take we all heed, how we live in our ſins after conviction: when the Lord once brings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the barr, arraigns us in our conſciences, by his word; ſhews us out ſins, and the ſmart of them; if, after all this, we ſhall continue in them, heavy, and juſt is our condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And this the ſtate of many, at this day, as of ſwearing, drunkenneſs, &amp;c. they know the hainouſneſs of them, yet practiſe them; and, is it not juſt with God, to condemn? A thief arraigned, convicted, &amp;c. but, by mercy of the judg reprieved, upon hope of better behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, if he ſhall ſtill perſiſt in theft, all acknowledg his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution moſt juſt.</p>
                  <p>Well, next, let us ſee unto whom Chriſt is ſent, as a judg: <hi>To ſoothſayers, and adulterers, &amp;c.</hi> Now, we are not ſo to underſtand the Prophet, as if he meant, that Chriſt ſhould be a judg of theſe particulars only; but, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. He includes all ſins, in general.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore then theſe mentioned only?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe moſt rife in the practice of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thence we learn, who are Miniſters, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
                     </label> to apply our proofes, and denunciations of judgments; as generally to all ſins, ſo moſt ſpecially, to thoſe particulars, rife in our people: It were long to evidence this by the practice of the Servants of God, the Prophets: See Iohn <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> how excellenly he fits his preſcripts to the nature of the people, <hi>Luk</hi> 3.10, 11. and, when he comes to <hi>Herod,</hi> he tells him of his particular ſin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.4. And <hi>Paul,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Felix,</hi> a bribing, and inceſtuous perſon, preacheth of juſtice, and temperance, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25.</p>
                  <p>It warrants like practice of miniſters, at this day, <label type="milestone">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96820:90"/>their own people; and, therefore, pleaſeth it God to ſet us over particular congregations, and to give us charge of them, that we might redreſs their ſins, And, howſoever that other courſe be moſt plauſible unto carnall men; I mean, generall dealing in inſtruction, admonition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; &amp;c. as, you ſhall hear ſuch preachers, that ſhoot at rovers in their Sermons, much applauded: yet this is the profitable kind of teaching: And therefore, in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, were there aſſiſtants unto the Miniſter, in particular congregations, to enquire, and give information of manners; and, if we had now ſuch as the houſehold of <hi>Cloe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.

                  <p>The firſt is that, that is exerciſed about prediction of of contigent events, not out of their cauſes, but by wayes not ſanctifyed of God; and this is of two ſorts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the perſons, that uſe them; one ſeemingly joyned with art; the other vulgar; theſe of divers ſorts; brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of each.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Pythones,</hi> or <hi>Pythoniſſae;</hi> ſuch as by acquaintance with familiar ſpirits, take upon them to reveale ſecrets,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96820:90"/>and to foretell things to come; of ſuch read, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.11. Beloved, I ſay not, we have ſuch in our own congregation; but, this, I fear, is too common amongſt us, upon every occaſion, conſulting with ſuch; if any thing loſt, or out of the way, preſently, a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diſpatched, to the cunning man, or the cunning woman: any ſickneſs dangerous, enquiries whether they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; if a journey undertaken, conſult of ſucceſs, &amp;c. As the Lord ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.18. Thou <hi>haſt been partaker with the adulterer;</hi> ſo ſurely, ſuch are partakers with Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers: And, it were to be wiſhed, that as there are laws wholeſome that way provided, ſo thoſe to whom executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof is committed, would put upon them this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and imitate his practice, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.24.</p>
                  <p>And, let us all be admoniſhed to take heed how we joyn with them. 1. See what is noted of <hi>Saul,</hi> before the Lord forſooke him; he took them away out of the land; when God had forſaken him, then goes he to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with a witch, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.7. 2. The Lord, by ſtrange judgments, hath ſhewn his diſlike of it; See 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. <hi>Ahaziah was ſick;</hi> and, as it's the faſhion of profane men, to be more inquiſitive, touching the iſſue, then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death; he ſends to <hi>Baal-zebub,</hi> the god of <hi>Ek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> to enquire, whether he ſhould recover: mark, how the Lord reaſons againſt him. 1. What a ſin is this, as if the devil, in <hi>Ekron,</hi> could better reſolve, then the God of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 2. He tels him, he ſhall ſurely dye, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, it came to paſs. 3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. The Lord taxing this ſin, preſcribes us the right means, how we ſhould know, what the ſucceſs of our enterpriſes will be; <hi>To the law, and to the teſtimony.</hi> When journeyes are ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, we have a promiſe of bleſſing; when otherwiſe, aſſure we our ſelves of a curſe, though all the devils in hell ſhall foretel a bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ſort, are Aſtrologers, or ſtart-gazers; who, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well ſaith, though under another colour, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96820:91"/>their art of foretelling things to come, by ſecret compact with the devil; of theſe the world was ever full; and, at this day, almoſt no place empty of them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are of ſundry ſorts. 1. <hi>Genethliaci,</hi> that by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating Nativities, and ſearching out the conſtellations, and aſpects of the ſtarrs, take upon them to foretel, what ſhould be the manners, ſtate of life, death, &amp;c. of men born under them. 2. Such, as of particular events in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes undertake to fortel events of things, in their own nature, contingent.</p>
                  <p>Theſe alſo not amongſt us; yet, I fear, every where conſulters with ſuch, That we arme our ſelves againſt them, let us ſee ſome reaſons out of the word of God. 1. ſtarrs made to another end, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14. namely, to meaſure out dayes and nights, ſummer and winter. 2. That they make good creatures, malignant. 3. The houſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves feigned things. 4. They but univerſal cauſes, and their influence mixt. 5. <hi>Gemini,</hi> or twins born in one hour, have divers iſſues. 6. Many other wayes doth the Lord deſcry their folly, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 46. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. ſhewing them to be but heathenniſh vanity. I might add unto theſe, thoſe that by dreames take upon them, to foretell things to come: now, it once pleaſed God, by dreames to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal particular events; not ſo now. So thoſe, that by looking on the hand, take upon them to foretell what ſhall be mens fortune; to theſe alſo may be added that ſame, which they call Necromancy, that is, divination, by conſulting with the dead; that is, indeed, with the devill, in the habit, and likeneſs of the dead: Of all which ye may read, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. <hi>Vulgaris;</hi> that which our common people, in ſuperſtitious ignorance, obſerve, of things boding good, or ill; as, how many ſuch obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have they of dismall days; wherein they ſay, its dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to begin any work: That, when a man puts his ſhooe on the wrong foot, that bodes ill; if the ſalt fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us on the table, ill luck; that, if the ſtaff fall out of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96820:91"/>the hand; a hare croſs our way; ſtumble at the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old, when we firſt go out of the houſe; or, if the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be gnawn of the Rats; of which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well notes the anſwer of <hi>Cato,</hi> an old wizard among the <hi>Romans.</hi> A ſuperſtitious obſerver of ſuch things came to him, as a man full of heavineſs; more grieving, ſaith he, at the ſuſpition of ill to come, then for loſs preſent; and, he would needs know, what hard chance that might bode. To whom the heathen anſwered merrily; that is no ſtrange thing, ſaith he, that Rats ſhould gnaw cloathes; the wonder had been, if thy cloathes had eat Rats; ſo did the heathen deride that folly, and ſuperſtition. And it ſhould admoniſh us Chriſtians, to deteſt, and abhorr ſuch idle ſuperſtitious obſervations, whereby, as much as by any, the devil ruleth in ſuch.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, that the event, many times, anſwers to their fear, and expectation. This comes, partly, through Gods judgment upon ſuch; partly, through Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to bewitch them with ſuch things: God gives them over to theſe deluſions, <hi>that they may believe lies,</hi> becauſe they have not received the love, and obedience of the truth, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond kinde of Sooth-ſaying, or <hi>Magick,</hi> is ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, that is, conſiſting in working things ſtrange and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond conceit; becauſe, we ſee not the reaſon of them; as we ſee in the ſorcerers about <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus;</hi> and the like, perhaps, at this day; ſtrange cures wrought by bringing inchanted napkins, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now, firſt, by natural cauſes known to Sathan; as of the lamp burning, in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> without oyl; a thing that hath a cauſe in nature; as <hi>Pliny</hi> of a ſtone called <hi>Aſphaeſtus,</hi> once ſet on fire, never quenched. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by deceiving of the ſence, as <hi>Pharao'hs</hi> Wizards, by agility of their nature, removing rods, bringing in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents Thirdly, perhaps alſo ſome marvels wrought, true for their nature, but falſe in their end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reaſons. 1. Gods
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96820:92"/>judgment upon ſuch, as believe ſuch things, 2. That thoſe that obtain ſuch gifts, might not be too much exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 3. To teach us, not raſhly to receive doctrines thus commended, but to bring them to the touch. 4. That we might not too much admire this gift; but labour for thoſe rather, that tend to edification, and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>And, in this rank may I alſo reckon thoſe ſo rife in every corner; charmers and ſorcerers: would God our own congregation were free! which is by procuring of words, to procure ſpeedy help, or hurt; and this is either plain; or covert, ſome meanes pretendedly uſed: againſt which, and all the reſt, See <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. Reaſons. 1. God caſt out the heathen for theſe. 2. Prophets ordained.</p>
                  <p>Againſt all which, theſe rules muſt be obſerved. 1. That they are all exerciſed, by a ſecret compact with Sathan: Reaſon; they have no ſuch force, by nature, divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or promiſe.</p>

                     <hi>From days of your Fathers.</hi>] That is, ever ſince your fathers gave you that ungracious example, and became patterns of diſobedience, ye have gone aſtray.</p>
                  <p>How prevalent with poſterity the example of parents is, eſpecially in evill: I might inſtance this, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſerv. </seg>
                     </label> in the State of <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> how many hundreds of years did idolatry continue in his lineage? And ſucceeding Kings of his Stock, went a whoring after the calves, in <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel:</hi> as the leproſie of <hi>Gehazi</hi> clave to him, and his poſterity; ſo the ſins of Parents, oft-times, to their children: Heare ſome reaſons of it. The 1. Is, that proneſs in nature, to imitate examples, either in good, or evill; eſpecially, in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren towards Parents; as we ſee, in common appearance in the leaſt of our infants, but newly crept out of their cradle: ſpeeches, geſtures, &amp;c. how apiſhly imitate they
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96820:93"/>them? 2. But ſpecially, this comes to paſs, by a judgment of God upon the children, for the fathers tranſgreſſion, threatned in the ſecond commandement, where he ſaith, he will viſit the ſins of the fathers upon the children.</p>
                  <p>If a man demande, how?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By withholding his grace from them, and giving them over to imitate their fathers ſins; and this, how ſee we it verified in daily experience? Popery, how long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues it in families popiſh!</p>
                  <p>This ſhould admoniſh all thoſe, of us, whom the Lord hath made parents, to take heed how we forſake the wayes of our God, and walk after the ſtubbornneſs of our own hearts.</p>
                  <p>Sundry reaſons I might give for this. 1. Examples in evill are always prevalent; like leaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. how ſoon it <hi>leavens the whole lumpe,</hi> we ſee; ſo ſpreads the infection of an evill example. 2. Me-thinks, the very miſery of our children ſhould move us; God hath made us fathers of their bodies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. And very birth is, in its own nature, a bleſſing; but yet if we ſhall bane them by our evill example, better had it been for them, never to be born; how diſcomfortable is it to parents, to ſee the ſhamefull ends of their children, as ſometimes on the gibbet? Can we grieve at this? Me-thinks, that other miſery of them, their eternall damnation, ſhould move us; murther of bodies odious, much more of ſoules.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, beloved, let us all be exhorted, to take heed, how, by a poyſonful example we corrupt the ſouls of our children: be diligent to bring up in the diſcipline, and information of the Lord; but be as careful to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, in an holy example of practice. Wouldeſt thou have children reverently uſe the name of God? beware how thou prophaneſt it, by ungodly ſwearing. Longeſt thou to wean them from wantonneſs, and love of pleaſure; and wouldeſt thou have them, even in youth, to renounce the vanities of life? Redeem thou the time: me-thinks,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96820:93"/>it's unreaſonable, that parents ſhould ſpend weeks and moneths in pleaſures, and yet expect reſtraint from paſtime, at the hands of their children: What is this, but to binde heavy burthens, and not to move them with the leaſt of our fingers?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this ſhould teach us to repent of our ſins, leſt we bequeath unto them, with our goods, our ſins alſo. Riches and poſſeſſions, they deſcend by inheritance, ſins alſo are ſometimes hereditary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdy, this ſhould be admonition unto children, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themſelves againſt the means ſo powerful, uſed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to pervert them: As much as for thine own, grieve for thy fathers ſins. I never knew an ungracious father, but he hath left behinde him ſome pledg of Gods diſpleaſure, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his children; yea though they have ſeen their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſins, and fled from them. I ſpeak now of temporal plagues, by which it pleaſeth God to viſit the ſins of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even in Godly children: And therefore this doe, when God gives thee eyes to ſee the ſins of thy parents, and to fly from them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. Humble thy ſelf, even for thy fathers ſins; See <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.18. But, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, learn to fly from them; and, for this cauſe, inform thy ſelf by the word of God, touching thy duty; and ever ſet thy ſelf theſe bounds, to follow thy father, no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he follows the Lords commandment; great is the benefit of ſuch wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Preſcription in errour is no feaſible plea, in the Court of the Lord. What if thou couldeſt ſay, Popery, whordom, covetouſneſs, &amp;c. had continued, in thy lineage, to a thouſand deſcents? This may aggravate thy ſin, but ſhall not excuſe it: And therefore obſerve, every where, how the Lord adds this, as the aggravating circumſtance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.10, <hi>Fourty years long was I grieved with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. <hi>Alwayes, ye have reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt; as your fathers did, ſo do ye.</hi>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96820:94"/>ones amongſt us; that becauſe they are able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in ſinning, therefore procure themſelves immunity, from the wrath of the Lord. How often hear we thoſe ſpeeches from our people? Thus have I alwayes uſed, and my father before me. Now, brethren, put it in ſome other caſe, in ſins againſt the ſecond table, and ſee how odious a defence this would be; if a man ſhould plead thus, in his whordom: thus my father hath uſed before me; if in theft, &amp;c. How ſhould we abhorr him? And yet in ſins, as vain as the excuſe is, muſt go for currant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.8. <hi>Be not as your fathers, a diſobedient, and rebellious generation;</hi> and, Pſal. 95.9. in tempting God, and hardneſs of heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.18. <hi>Walk not in the ordinances of your fathers, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file your ſelves with Idols,</hi> and, for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now, mark the forward uſe, prophane men make of this doctrine; <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Well, beloved, this is true; <hi>But, ſhall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound? God forbid!</hi> Rom. 6.1. Know we, therefore, that that God who hath promiſed to give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, whenſoever repentance is performed, hath not all-wayes given repentance, when it's ſought for; nay, hath threatened to deny repentance to them, that contemning it offered in the means, reſpit the day of their converſion unto God: How howls <hi>Eſau</hi> for the bleſſing? How fain would he come to heaven? How bewailes he the loſs of Gods favour with tears? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it not; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what ſaith wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1, 24, 26. <hi>I called,</hi> you heard not; you ſhall call, but ſhall not be heard, you <hi>ſhall ſeek mee early, but not finde mee:</hi> And therefore, mark, what <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek the Lord, while he may be found.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is there any time, when the Lord will not be found?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, no doubt; not, but that his mercy is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, but, for that men cannot ſeek it, when the time is over-ſlipt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24 13.</p>
                  <p>Hence then, let us learn, beloved, that perhaps have lived long in our ſins, now at the length to ſeek God, if he may be found of us: And mark, how lovingly the Lord invites us, who have gone aſtray, &amp;c. a long time; yet return unto mee, and I will turn unto you; as if he had ſaid, yet at the length return, there is hope of mercy, and forgiveneſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the Lord is the ſame to us, as he was to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſtill ſaith to us, as to them; though ye have long gone aſtray, yet, if now at length, we could return, there were hope of mercy, and forgiveneſs.</p>
                  <p>Let me thus apply it to every of us; and let us all think this ſpoken to our ſelves: Thou that art ignorant, and lived thus, all thy life long; if now, at length, thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be admoniſhed to repent, God regards not thy paſt ſins, upon performance of preſent repentance; ſo to all other ſinners; and mark how the Lord proteſts, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights

                  <p>And, let not Sathan prevail with thee, ſo far, as to think, as the ſaying is, too late now; for, the promiſe of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made to repentance, without all limitation of time, perſon, or number of offences: and this be aſſured, out of the word of God; that howſoever there is no ſin ſo light, but deſerves a thouſand hells; yet, none deadly, in the event, but impenitency; yea, the very ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt were capable of pardon, if capable of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

                  <p>What learn we hence? Surely, to take notice of our own miſery, whoſe hearts the Lord hath not yet turned unto him; we are as men, in a wilderneſs; fain, perhaps, we would finde the way to heaven but cannot; nay, the more we ſtrive, the further, out of the way; and this is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of every impenitent ſinner.

                  <p>Secondly, refuſe not the Lords corrections, but embrace

Though Idolaters err in their apprehenſion, yet, when they have once conceived a god-head, they are careful to maintain his worſhip; and conſcionably abſtain from purloyning any thing that may thither ſerve.

                     </label> let me propound the judgment of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſound Divines, both wayes, and leave it to Gods people, to be judged of. Divine right, therefore, is doubly underſtood. 1. Either, that it is directly ſo, by expreſs and preciſe commandment; or elſe. 2. By conſequent, as having ground in the word of God. The diſtinction is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.6. I, not the Lord; the Lord, not I: I have no commandment, but give advice.</p>
                  <p>Now, this is the judgment of ſome ancient, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines: That, by Divine law, the tenths of all fruites, both predial, and perſonal, are due unto miniſters of the Goſpel, by thoſe very lawes, that were given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Levites, <hi>Origen, in Num. Hom.</hi> 11. This law of Tythes, he thinks ſhould be obſerved, according to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96820:98"/>the letter. <hi>Hierome,</hi> upon this place, accords with him. <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes Tythes to miniſters, and tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> of equal right. Divines, of late years, accord with them: <hi>Junius;</hi> Tythes, by all lawes, of God, nature, nations, have been hallowed unto God. <hi>Gaulter.</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>&amp; Zepper de leg. lib.</hi> 4.10. are peremptory, this way; and demand, with what reaſons it may be proved, that the law was merely ceremonial</p>
                  <p>Hear their reaſons; becauſe payd before the law, when ceremonies were not in force; as by <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizédech;</hi> this argument concludes not, for, even ſome ceremonies were in force, before the law of ceremonies given in writing; as ſacrifices, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Better reaſons are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that we are not able to ſhew, what was in this law ceremonial; therefore, not ſo to be eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Origen</hi> thus. As Gods bleſſings, under the new Teſtament, exceed thoſe vouchſafed unto the Jews; ſo ſhould our maintenance: This proves thus much only, that as liberal, if not more, is due to the miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, greateſt reaſon that of <hi>Iunius;</hi> that by all lawes due; very light of nature taught Gentiles to hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the tenth unto God; whence, may thus be concluded. That what, by inſtinct of nature, is due, that is perpetual; for, this is one rule, to diſcern judicial lawes of common equity, from thoſe of equity particular; namely, if they be univerſally received by all nations; and accord with the word of God: but thus, it's apparent, that in all ages of heathen, they were due.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Ab abſurdo,</hi> it ſeems not likely, that the Lord providing ſo liberally for maintenance of Levites; would leave all uncertain to the devotion of the people, under the new Teſtament; but other certainty, is not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons are ſomething urgent: And, I muſt needs
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96820:98"/>profeſs, to ſee no certainty of anſwer to them.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond opinion is, of them, that hold them to be due, by conſequent, from the law of God; though no direct law given concerning them. As, 1. From the command of the Magiſtrate, to whom they imagine the Lord to have left determining of particulars, only with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; ſo it be competent. 2. By vertue of confecration that way, either by vow, or other wholeſome ordinance: And thus they think them due unto us; ſo that he ſhall be guilty of ſacriledg, that withholds, or alienates them; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15. A (mans) teſtament no man abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates; <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25. <hi>Its a deſtruction, to devoure Holy things, and after the vow, to enquire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third ſort think them utterly unlawfull, to be either paid, or exacted; in as much, as it was a part of ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law; and, for this cauſe, amongſt others, abandon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety with our Church, becauſe, as they ſay, we judaize in maintaining our Miniſters, by tenths: Theſe need rather pity, in reſpect of their zeal; then confutation of their judgment: It being a principle holden, amongſt all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; that judiciall lawes, eſpecially, when there appeares not ſome evident cauſe why they ſhould concerne only the State of the <hi>Iowes,</hi> may juſtily be revived in Chriſtian Common-wealths; nay, that Common-wealths are beſt governed, that come neareſt that plat-forme.</p>
                  <p>What my judgment is, I will forbear to propoſe; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing only an inclination this way; that they are due, by divine right, for ſome reaſons before ſpecified.</p>
                  <p>To leave theſe [Uncertainties:] See what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (certainly) teacheth, touching maintenance of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.</p>

                     </label> beloved, where ſhould I begin to reprove? Firſt, thoſe ingroſſers of Miniſters maintenance, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations; &amp;c. I ſtand not now to diſpute the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this only know, things once conſecrated, are the Lords, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27, 30, 31. and may not, for ever, be aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 2. This holden by all Divines; that ſo to alienate, as that there be not a liberall maintenance for the Miniſter, for all works of his calling, is generally holden an accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed practice: And, what maintenance is this, <hi>Micah's</hi> allowance? <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17. A, Livery dyet, and ten ſhekells of ſilver; ſurely, the platform I think was firſt taken from that Idolater: But, beloved, let ſuch men conſider, how many ſouls periſh, for lack of Miniſters: I know what they ſay, blame the law: <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked. Gal.</hi> 6.7. There is a law of equity ſhould guide every chriſtian, and they ſhould be laws unto themſelves.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> So, indeed, they ſay, who are deeplyeſt engaged this way; but, it will be hard to prove, that deſire of a competency, comes under the cenſure of covetouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, guilty of this ſin alſo, are all thoſe that detain any thing due, from the maintenance of the worſhip of God: I know it will be ſaid, I am now in my own har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt. But, ſith it pleaſeth God, to give ſo juſt occaſion; judg, I pray you, in charity; that I preach of conſcience, not of commodity.</p>
                  <p>And, this let me ſay, from my own, and other mens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; men moſt liberall to other profane uſes, think any thing too much, that is given to the Miniſtery.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould be the cauſe of it? Surely. 1. That root of all evill, covetouſneſs. 2. Lack of feeling ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and comfort, by the Miniſtery; ſurely, if Spirituall things were reaped, temporall things would flow, of own accord. But, to what cauſe ſhould we impute the ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handedneſs of men profeſſing of Religion, and the fear of God; that they, notwithſtanding, ſhould ſo niggardly contribute; and paying never ſo little, look for a cap, and courteſie from the Miniſter?</p>
                  <p>Let me add ſome Reaſons, for exhortation. 1. Its an honouring of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. 2. It argues, that we have taſted ſweetneſs in the word, and are, indeed, partakers of ſpirituall things. 3. Conſider but the example of very Idolaters, this way; as of papiſts, at this day: and, let it ſhame us Chriſtians. 4. Detaining brings Gods curſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25.5. Mark, what the Lord here ſpeaks, it brings down ſcarcity, and famine upon the land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye are curſed with a curſe</hi>] The puniſhment; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallity of it; obſtinacy of the Jews, notwithſtanding thus afflicted.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bring ye all my Tythes</hi>] For this was the ordinance of God, partly, to free the Levites from diſtractions; and partly, to prove the fidelity, and willingneſs of the people, this way, that they ſhould bring the Tythes to the place appointed; a ſtore-houſe provided for that purpoſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Lord propounds this mean to remove his wrath; we may obſerve, what courſe to take,<note place="margin">Oſerv.</note> when Gods hand is upon us; namely, to give our ſelves to practice of thoſe duties, for omiſſion whereof, Gods wrath is come out againſt us: and this propounded, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16.

                     </label> This kinde of ſpeech is not frequent in Scripture; ſome thing like it, is that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 34.8.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96820:102"/>happy were they! <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 4.7. Speaking of the joy the wicked had in earthly things, profeſſed; that he found far more comfort and joy, in the ſervice of God, then they had, or could have, <hi>in the encreaſe of their corn, wine, and oyle:</hi> And, if thoſe ſluggardiſh fooles amongſt us, that have a price put into their hands to get wiſdome, but have no heart, would conſider this! They think it is too late to learn; their wits, and memories, are grown dull: Oh yet, do but prove the Lord; wait at the poſts of his doors, hear, read, confer, pray God, prove him a little; he hath promiſed, that <hi>they that ſeek wiſdome ſhall finde, Prov.</hi> 2.4. Prove him, and ſee, whether thou finde him not full as good as his promiſe.</p>
                  <p>There is an unlawful, and damnable proving, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord; we call it commonly, tempting God. It is, when men preſumptuouſly make needleſs experiments of the truth of God, eſpecially in his threatnings. The Lord hath given charge unto the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould, on the evening of the Sabbath, provide for that might ſuffice, on the Sabbath; and told them, that on the Sabbath, they ſhould finde none; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, there went out ſome, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.27. To gather on the Sabbath day: they would try, whether the Lord would be as good, as his word. So likewiſe, a charge he gave, that if the manna they gathered for every daies proviſion, they ſhould keep none, till the morning; yet, were there ſome, that would needs reſerve, for experiment, to ſee what would come of it; it was full of worms, and ſtank. He had likewiſe given ſtrict charge unto the people, that they ſhould take heed of doing any thing, preſumptuouſly, againſt the Lord; and told them, they ſhould dye; there goeth out one, notwithſtanding, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. To gather ſticks: he would try what the Lord would do to him; and the Lord cauſed him to be ſtoned.</p>
                  <p>And, of this kinde of preſumptuous proving the Lord, the world is full. The Lord hath threatened to him that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96820:102"/>encreaſeth his riches by uſury, and unjuſt gain, that he ſhall lay it up for another: yet, mark, notwithſtanding this be exemplyfied ſtill, in the courſe of Gods providence, they will prove the Lord; and they will ſee, whether goods ſo gotten may not be permanent. So likewiſe, that the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Drunkards ſhall be cloathed with raggs, how often ſee we it exemplyfied? and yet, how many are there, that preſumptuouſly will herein prove the Lord! The Lord hath taught us, that theordinary means to come by faith, is, by the word of God; and that prayers are all curſed, and abominable, when that is deſpiſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. Yet mark, how many, preſumptuouſly, make trial of the Lord; and they, forſooth, wil ſee, whether, by other means, they cannot be ſaved. He hath threatned, that he that deferrs repentance, when it's offered, ſhall never come to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. Yet, how many be there, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with prove the Lord! they will put it to the trial, and ſee whether repentance may not come, on the death-bed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, this is a fearful provoking ſin; and they, that thus prove him, ſhall finde him, in the proofe, a terrible God to them.</p>
                  <p>What then is this proof of the Lord, herepermitted unto the people of God? It is, when a man, in faith of Gods promiſe, uſeth thoſe means preſcribed for his comfort, expecting, by hope, the performance of what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
                  <p>And it hath in it, three things. 1. A promiſe of God, to reſt on. 2. Walking in the wayes, that God hath preſcribed. 3. Expectation of performance, in uſe of the means. Or, briefly thus; when a man uſing the means preſcribed, waits for the performance of what is promiſed: as, in this place, here is. 1. Promiſe of plenty. 2. The means, repentance. 3. Faith, in uſe of the means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Now, when a man fails in any of theſe, he proves God, indeed; but, that proving is tempting: As for example,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96820:103"/>when a man throwes himſelf into an unneceſſary danger, he hath no promiſe of protection; as the devil tempted Chriſt to do, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.6. He may make experiment of Gods truth, ſo doing; but indeed, is a tempter of God. So likewiſe, when a man having holy means preſcribed, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects to uſe them; as, having meat, looks to be fed, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> was, by Angels, that he may prove God; this alſo is tempting of God.</p>
                  <p>See we the means, with this, now preſcribed; the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will be.</p>
                  <p>A man, that would have a comfortable experience of Gods truth in his promiſes, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> muſt tye himſelf preciſely to thoſe means, that the Lord preſcribes, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.31. The Apoſtle had received a promiſe from God, for preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, and his company, in the ſhipwrack; they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhip like to break, begin by means (not preſcribed) to provide for themſelves; but the Apoſtle tels them, that unleſs they tarry in the ſhip, they cannot be ſafe.</p>
                  <p>And, let it teach us, to walk in Gods high-way, if we look for comfortable deliverance, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Secondly, ſuch, as in dangers, and extremities, betake themſelves to means of their own, that have no warrant from God. As, how many in theſe dayes of ſcarcity, to pilfering, and ſtealing, prophanation of the Lords Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath &amp;c.

                  <p>Now, beloved, that we could be perſwaded, by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to ſeek the Lord, and would prove him, a whiles, with this, as we have provoked him by our ſins; ſo, we would prove him, a little, with repentance; how eaſily could the Lord turn our penury, into abundance? It was a prophane ſpeech of the Prince, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Though the Lord ſhould open the windowes of Heaven, this thing could not come to paſs.</hi> And, as prophane is the thought of our people; becauſe, perhaps, we ſee no means: mens hearts (we ſay) are hardend, &amp;c. But, in whoſe hand are the hearts of men? How moved he the hearts of the people, that led <hi>Iſrael</hi> captive, to pity them? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.46. See Gods favour to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the eyes of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> that before had oppreſſed them; neither is his hand ſhortened. Prove the Lord with this.</p>

When <hi>Eliſha</hi> tells him, with what cruelty he ſhould uſe the people of God; what, is thy ſervant a dogg, that I ſhould do this thing? ſo, many of us: But, conſider we. 1. How ſtrongly we are enclined to every ſin, by nature; not blaſphemy, not murther, not Atheiſme excepted: that any of us are not as vile, as the vileſt Atheiſt, it proceeds from Gods grace reſtraining us. 2. That we have no other bridle, but the grace of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.6. I kept thee: and, longer then this Divine bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle curbs us, no hope of ſtay; man, ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> is, in his nature, born as the wilde aſſes colt in the wilderneſs; he drinks iniquity like water; when that bridle is gone, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther run we not? even to thoſe ſins, that nature teacheth, to be abominable. 3.

                  <p>Pray we, therefore, to God continually, to put his fear into our hearts, that we may never depart away from him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.40. And, if any of us have fallen, make haſte to riſe, not by coloured, but by hearty repentance.

                  <p>Let us next conſider the words themſelves; <hi>its vain to ſerve God</hi>] See the like profane ſpeech of Atheiſts, <hi>Iob.</hi> 21.15. Nor may we much marvail at this, in profane men; for, its that, that hath aſſaulted the dear ſervants of God; <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth ſo much of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>What are the meanes, whereby the devill inſinuates this thought into our hearts? 1. It is the preſent afflicted State of Gods children, betwixt whom, and wicked men, we can ſee no difference, in externall things; nay rather, we ſee affliction the portion of Gods children; outward proſperity granted to the ungodly. 2. Another cauſe is, that we walk by ſence, and not (as we ought) by faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. And becauſe, we ſenſibly feel not Gods love, therefore think, he is not gracious unto us, nor regards us; and, how many times, upon this ground, look we back to <hi>Egypt?</hi> 3. Too much admiring the things of this life: The gariſhneſs of honour, and wealth, and pleaſures, it ſo dazels our eyes that we think them the only happy men, that enjoy them; our ſelves miſerable for nothing elſe, but for that we want them.</p>
                  <p>Let us then ſee a little, what profit there is in religion, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> and the ſervice of God heartily performed 1 2. How we may arme our ſelves, againſt this temptation.</p>
                  <p>See we, then, the benefit of the ſervice of God: this is of two ſorts: 1. The one ſeen and felt, in this life. 2. The other, in another life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. The benefits of this life are, either outward, or inward: Outward ſo free, and warrantable uſe of all the creatures of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. And, what a benefit is this? We uſe to ſay of our own; though but little, yet, its mine own, and I may comfortably enjoy it; not ſo the caſe of wicked men. 2. A ſecond benefit, is, protection in common calamities, See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. &amp; 91. And, howſoever it pleaſe God to chaſtiſe particular diſobedience, to take them away, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with others; yet then failes he not of his promiſe,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96820:106"/>but turns into better. 3. A third benefit is peace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. And that. 1. With God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. Thus they may aſſure themſelves, in all hatred of men; yet, God loves them, and is favourable unto them. 2. Peace with themſelves, in their own conſcience; that, whereas the wicked and ungodly, are alwaies, as the raging ſea, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57, <hi>ult.</hi> and no peace unto them; Gods children have peace in their conſcience. 3. Peace with all creatures, in Heaven, and Earth; the very Angels wait on them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Devils themſelves cannot hurt them. 4. Add unto theſe that which, indeed, is the true riches, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.5. &amp; <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. Plenty of knowledg; contentment in all States, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6, 8.</p>
                  <p>Now, beloved, if a man ſhould conſider theſe unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joyes, that God hath provided for his children; who can ſay, that it is in vain to ſerve the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is it nothing, that a man hath right to all creatures? Nothing, to be preſerved in common calamities? Nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have Gods favour, peace of conſcience, which wicked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would, ſometimes, redeem with all the world? Nothing, that God hath called us to a lively hope, to an inheritance immortal? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 14. Let them ſo ſpeak, that have no taſte of theſe things; Gods children are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded.</p>
                  <p>Now ſee among our ſelves, againſt theſe temptations; as 1. afflictions.</p>

                     </label> And let us but hear the common cenſure, that worldlings paſs of religion: Look, ſay they, and ſee what kinde of men they are, that are the forwardeſt in religion; poor raskal people, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, in compariſon; right, as the Phariſees, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.48. Now, brethren, though that be not generally true; for, it pleaſeth God to ſhew his power; and, though not <hi>many rich,</hi> and <hi>mighty,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. Yet ſome; and, ſee how rich theſe others are in faith, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.5.</p>
                  <p>And here, let us a little ſee, why it pleaſeth the Lord to keep his children ſo low, in this life. Reaſons are. 1. To mortifie, and abate their ſins: Thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf, in the multitude of thy riches; Oh, how bleſſed were it for thee, if thou hadſt leſs wealth, and more grace! And, what happineſs ſhould the Lord do thee, if he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive thee of that abundance, that ſteals away thine heart from God! 2. To juſtifie their ſincerity, that it may
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96820:107"/>be ſeen, they ſerve not God, for commodity, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.9. 3. To teach them, and us all, that the hope of a Chriſtian, is not in this life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. 4. To magnifie the power of his grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their weakneſs, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how many are there, that even for this, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to embrace religion, becauſe, they ſee, religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them not their benefits. They could be content to be religious, as the young man, in the Goſpel; but, they love not the conditions, ſuch ſtrictneſs; that a penny muſt not be gotten, but with good conſcience. Now mark, my brethren, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.30. that Chriſt hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed all that may be expedient; and wouldeſt thou have wealth that ſhould hinder thy ſalvation? 2. Conſider, that if thou loſe all, yet God gives contentment; and that is a benefit, which no worldling can attain. If thou ſee but the carking and toyl, that ſuch earth-worms are put unto, me-thinks, thou ſhouldſt never envy them their plenty, with ſuch conditions. 3. Obſerve what a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of noyſome luſts they pierce themſelves through withal. 4. <hi>With the Lord are durable riches, Prov.</hi> 8.18.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſuch alſo as for the exchange of things in theſe dayes of the Goſpel, run back, in their affections, to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. As the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they came to the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and were but a little pinch'd with hunger, cry out; it had been better for them, to have ſitten by the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, and garlicke, and onyons of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And, how many ſuch, that wiſh for Popery, for no other end, then that they might again enjoy the old plenty, and happineſs of all things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And now, we call the proud happy</hi>] That is, they thought thoſe that walked in the ſtubbornneſs of their hearts, againſt God, more happy, than they. Reaſon, becauſe they were delivered, and freed from afflictions. Shall I need to ſay, This is the ſtate and opinion of our
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96820:107"/>people. How do they applaud the ſtate of ungodly men, in reſpect of their outward proſperity? And, how happy think they ſuch, as abound with things of this life, though wholly deſtitute of the graces of Gods Spirit? yet look but upon ſuch a profeſſour, you ſhall ſee him leſs friended, leſs honoured, and living at leſs hearts eaſe, Now, that we fall not into this blaſphemy; let us ſee, a little, the reaſon, why it pleaſeth God, thus to deal with ungodly men? And, ye ſhall finde, he doth it, for this end.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to fat them <hi>againſt the day of ſlaughter,</hi> as we are wont to put our cattel deſtin'd to the ſlaughter, into the fatteſt, and faireſt paſtures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32. <hi>Eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh;</hi> ſee alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. and 73.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to teach his own children, not too much to admire the things of this life, which they ſee the very wicked themſelves may be, and are partakers of: Who would dote upon thoſe things, which when a man hath, make him, never a whit, the more happy; yea, perhaps, further, through abuſe, his condemnation?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to aggravate their judgment, when as by ſo many bleſſings of God, they have been allured to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and have had ſo plentiful means of doing good, and yet have done none.</p>

That they ſtand up, to ſtop the mouth of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and to maintain Gods truth againſt the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof. 2. That they labour to ſtabliſh one another, in perſwaſion of Gods truth, and care of his children.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That they think upon his name.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe properties, ſee in all the Saints of God, <hi>Iob</hi> 32.19. When <hi>Elihu</hi> had heard the fond reaſonings, and cenſures of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends; as if afflictions could not, with Gods juſtice, be inflicted on Gods ſervants; the Spirit was in him, even as new wine in veſſels, without vent, and he could not keep ſilence. <hi>Ieremy, cap.</hi> 20.9. when he ſaw, that the word of God became a reproach unto him, that the people fell a ſcoffing at his moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reprehenſions, and ſevere denunciations of judgment againſt the ſins of the people, he profeſſeth of himſelf, that (in his weakneſs) he had reſolved, and almoſt vowed to ſpeak no more, in the name of the Lord; but thy word (ſaith he) was in me as fire, and he was weary of bearing, when he heard the railing, and blaſphemy of the multitude, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.3. <hi>David,</hi> he alſo had a purpoſe to keep ſilence before the wicked, but that ſamefiery Spirit of God, would not let him be at reſt, he muſt ſpeak, or burſt aſſunder, &amp;c. See alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. I might be infinite this way. If any man demand the reaſon of it, it's nothing but this, the ardent, and fiery love that is in them, to the glory of God; having taſted of his love in Chriſt, they cannot indure to ſee Gods name diſhonoured; life it ſelf not ſo precious unto them, as Gods glory. Beſides, this is the very work of the Spirit of God, as our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. he is compared unto fire; as in other reſpects, ſo for this alſo, that he is of a ſtrong and operative nature, in the hearts of the children of God; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. He is ſayd, in <hi>Noah,</hi> to have ſtriven with men.</p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:96820:110"/>
                  <p>By this, let us try our ſelves, whether our hearts be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with the fear of Gods name, indeed, or no: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, we cannot have a ſurer teſtimony of the ſoundneſs of Gods graces in us, then this; the fearleſs maintaining, and defending of the Lords cauſe, againſt the adverſaries, and blaſphemers of Gods truth. Look then, and ſee how thou findeſt thy heart affected, when thou heareſt the blaſphemies of the multitude.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, theſe, and as great blaſphemies, we are, ſome of us, forced to hear from prophane men, in the Church of God: Its vain, to ſerve God, and, what get they, by theirzeale, but hatred, and obloquy, and trouble amongſt men? Now, when thou heareſt any of Gods truth's blaſphemed, and evil ſpoken of; how feeleſt thou thy ſelf affected? Goeth it not to thy heart, nearer, than any thine own outward reproach? elſe, ſuſpect thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And, alas, beloved, to ſee the ſtate of moſt men, this way, argues a nullity of Gods fear in their hearts. If it be but a friends name called in queſtion, how do we ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? If our own credit never ſo little impeached, and queſtioned, that kindles us, and ſets all on fire; but, if Gods name be blaſphemed, his word traduced, his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances violated, &amp;c. How keep we ſilence, as if this, of all other things, did leaſt concern us. Beloved, this is the effect of Gods fear in the hearts of his children, to be much affected at the diſhonour of his name.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Iehu</hi> approached neer unto <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> and eſpyed her, in her window, trimming her ſelf, after the faſhion of harlots; he cryes out to them with her. <hi>Who is on my ſide, who? and the Eunuchs threw her down.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the Lord ſeems,<note place="margin">2 King. 9.32.</note> ſometimes, thus to ſay to us, in the extremities of the peoples blaſphemies; and he ſeems to cry unto us, <hi>Who is on my ſide?</hi> If then thou be ſilent; that which our Saviour hath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.30. will be here applyed; <hi>who is not</hi> him, <hi>is</hi> ſure <hi>againſt</hi> him; and ſo ſhall be accepted, in the day of acounts.</p>

And this, as it is the practice of Gods Saints, every where, ſo hath it the precept, and commandment of God, <hi>Jude</hi> 23. <hi>Edifie one another in your moſt holy faith.

The evilneſs of the times, wherein we ſee it verifyed; that the love of many waxeth cold. 2. Look we to the carriage of all things; and ſee, whether we find it not true, that theſe Atheiſts here ſpeak of; the wicked are ſet up; ſo that, if there were not an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another life, it were better to be any thing, even the vileſt miſcreant, then to profeſs the fear of the Lord. 3. Thoſe many diſcouragements, that we ſhall ſee raiſed up to the Children of God. Beloved, if ever that were needfull, that our Saviour ſpeaks, ſtrengthen thy brethren, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. Now are the days. 4. And, methinks, if there were no other reaſon, then that induſtrious, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wearied paines of the adverſary, to ſubvert the faith of Gods Children, it ſhould move us: Shall the limbs of the divell be more painfull, to overthrow, then we to

                  </p>
                  <p>Third ſign, and property of them; they think upon Gods Name. For explication, know we, that Gods name is, ſometimes, put for the Majeſty of God himſelf; ſometimes, for his glory; whether ſence we take it, it matters not. Its true, that a man fearing God, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is alwaies, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> to have God before his eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. The Lord is ever, and continually, in his meditation: Or, if we take the other ſence, this alſo ſhall be found their practice; they think upon his name, that is, that's one principall part of their care, and ſtudy, how God may be glorifyed, and his name kept from diſhonour, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy: That, whereas the uttermoſt care of a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is, how he may grow great upon earth; the care of Gods children is, how God may beſt be glorifyed; and he is ever deviſing ſomething, within the compaſs of his calling, how farr glory may come to the Name of God. When <hi>David</hi> was now at reſt, and ſate in his houſe; mark, what thoughts his minde was poſſeſſed withall; conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what an houſe he had built for himſelf, to dwell in; he thus ſpeaks to <hi>Nathan</hi> his ſeer: Behold, ſaith he, I

                  <p>By this alſo try we our ſelves, and our uprightneſs in the ſight of God. Surely, who ſo findes not this in himſelf, that his principal thought, and care is, that God may be glorified; I may boldly ſay of that man, he is none of Gods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is it then not lawful, to think of the things of this life?</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> No doubt, yes; but, in getting of theſe, this is the difference betwixt Gods children, and another. That which the man who feareth God, aimeth at, is this; that God may be glorified; ſo, in ſports, no doubt lawful, ſo be, they are lawfully and moderately uſed; but, look that this be thy end, that thou mayeſt be fitter to glorifie God, and do him ſervice; elſe, thou uſeſt recreations as an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, not as a childe of God.</p>
                  <p>Well, now hear what it is, that they avouch. <hi>A book of remembrance</hi> is written for <hi>thoſe that fear God</hi>] This is ſpoken, after the manner of men, for our capacity; that, as men uſe, for better remembrance, to keep a book of <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum's,</hi> that they may not forget; See <hi>Heſt.</hi> 6.1. So, this is attributed unto God, to ſignifie unto us, that he doth certainly remember the ſervices of his children.</p>
                  <p>Hence then, the collection is eaſie; <label type="milestone">

                  <p>This alſo ſhould encourage Miniſters, though of all others, their labours be moſt ſlenderly regarded amongſt men, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.4. <hi>I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength; nevertheleſs, my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God.</hi> Thus ſhould Magiſtrates encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage themſelves, though for conſcionable diſcharge of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they receive nothing amongſt men, but ſhame, and reproach; let it be enough, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> prayes, that the Lord remembers thee in this: So, in works of mercy: though, perhaps, thou feareſt to loſe it, even as if thou ſhouldeſt caſt it down the waters, yet, after many days, thou ſhalt finde it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.1. &amp;c.</p>

A deſcription of <hi>Iohns</hi> perſon, by his gifts, ſet out in reſemblance of him to <hi>Elias;</hi> therefore, called metaphorically, <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet. 2. The time of his coming, namely, immediately, before the coming of that great, and fearful day. 3. By his effect, he ſhall convert; the action amplyfied, by the ſubject, and terms, <hi>hearts of children to fathers,</hi> and of fathers, to children: And, by the end, <hi>leſt I come and ſmite the earth, withour ſing.</hi> As touching the ſenſe of the words, the quaere is betwixt us, and <hi>Pontificians,</hi> what is here meant, by <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet? Whether <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Thiſbite,</hi> in perſon; or, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> metaphorically, and analogically, called <hi>Elias?</hi> Papiſts, in the queſtion touching the time of Antichriſts comming, generally underſtand it, of <hi>Elias,</hi> in perſon: and hence, thus conclude, that Antichriſt is not yet come, becauſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> who muſt come in the time of Antichriſt, are not yet come in perſon.</p>
                  <p>Their concluſion, that Antichriſt is not yet come, they go about to prove, by ſix ſignes, which muſt be of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts coming. Two foregoing. 1. Preaching of the Goſpel to all nations. 2. Deſolation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Two accompanying it. 1. The Preaching of <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> in perſon. 2. Bloudy perſecution, in ſuch ſort, that publique worſhip of God ſhall ceaſe. Two following it. 1. The deſtruction of Antichriſt, after three yeares, and an half. 2. The end of the world.</p>

                  <p>But, none of theſe are yet accompliſhed: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Now as touching this controverſie, at large, my purpoſe is not to ſpeak: nor yet to deal with any other reaſon, but this, that they take out of this text.</p>
                  <p>In the dayes of Antichriſt, <hi>Henoch,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> muſt come in perſon, to preſerve the Elect, in the faith of Chriſt, and convert the Jews; but they are not yet come: <hi>Ergo.</hi> To ſay nothing of <hi>Enoch,</hi> but to inſiſt in that, they urge for <hi>Elias;</hi> that he muſt live in the dayes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, they labour to prove. 1. By teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of Fathers. 2. By reaſons, out of the text. Their teſtimonies of ſcripture, are three. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.3. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We will, firſt, propound our judgment, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it; and then anſwer to the objections of Papiſts. This, then, is the truth; that by <hi>Elias</hi> is here meant <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> the fore-runner of Chriſt Jeſus. And, if any man ask, why he is called <hi>Elias?</hi> The Angel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17. gives the reaſon, becauſe he goes before Chriſt, in <hi>the Spirit and power of Elias:</hi> This likeneſs there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. 1. In office, reforming of the Church. 2. Gifts of courage, boldneſs, liberty of ſpeech. 3. In habite, not unlike. 4. In people, with whom they dwell.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, we have the teſtimony of the Angell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17: Alledging this very Scripture, and applying it to Iohn <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> 2. Expoſition of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.10, 11, 12. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.14.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The things theſe ſpoken of, cannot, in any hand, agree to <hi>Elias;</hi> Reaſons. 1. He never ſaw death, before his aſſumption; unlikely therefore, that, after glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he ſhould dye. 2.

                     </label> what we may hence obſerve, is this; how the Lord, according to neceſſity of times of the Church, doth, extraordinarily, furniſh his ſervants, with the gift of his Spirit, according to the calling, whereto he aſſigns them.</p>

                     </label> then, we may judg of all men, who ever they are, that undertake extraordinary works, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the Church of Chriſt. As, we have thoſe in the Church of Rome; the head of that Church, takes on
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96820:117"/>him, the government of the whole Church of God; a burthen not meete for any mens ſhoulders: And, yet, as themſelves confeſs of ſuch, they are men but of ordinary meaſure of gifts, of knowledg, wiſdome, or other abilities: Now ſurely, if the Lord had ſent them to ſuch a work; we ſhould ſee this ſeale ſet unto them; gifts extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, meete for ſuch a function.

                  <p>Some caveats muſt here be remembred. 1. That this muſt be underſtood of the ſetled, and ſtabliſhed preaching of the word; for otherwiſe, God ſends ſome, only, to deprive of excuſe. 2. That fruit, at firſt, appears not; but lyeth, as it were, under the clods; See <hi>Act.</hi> 18.10. And, as it was, in the days of <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.18.</p>

                  <p>Again, ſee we a little, and judg we of our ſelves, and we ſhall know, whether the Lord hath, in mercy, ſent the Miniſtery of the word unto us; ſurely, if Gods word have wrought in us, to converſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, We may then ſay, the Lord, in mercy, hath ſent it unto us; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he hath not ſent in mercy, but in wrath: See 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13.

                  <p>See we yet, farther, the degrees of efficacy of the word of God. 1. It prevails with ſome, to illumination. 2. With ſome, to work a little temporary delight, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. 3. With ſome, to a partiall reformation, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.20. 4.
